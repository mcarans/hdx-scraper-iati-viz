   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve Access to Income Generation and Job Opportunities for Host and IDP Communities through an Inter-cropping Agricultural System in Northwest Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall goals of the project are to maximize agricultural production through maximizing land use, improving food diversity, and improving access to additional income for the most affected small and mid-sized olive farmers through Intercropping Agriculture System. Moreover, the project aims to create temporary job opportunities for IDPs in the target locations by involving them in Cash for Work - CFW- for the harvesting of crops planted between olive trees. More specifically, 550 olive farmers will be supported with agricultural inputs seeds, fertilizers pesticides, sufficient to farm three dunums of winter fava bean and two dunums of peas, in addition to support olive trees with Soluble NPK fertilizer for spring fertilization of olive trees and pesticides that will improve olive farm productivity. Also, 917 women of the IDP community, over the age of 18, who displaced since December 1, 2019, will be involved in working for 20 days in CFW for the harvesting of crops planted through Inter-cropping Agricultural System with daily wages of 6 USD. Olive farmers and CFW workers will be selected based on the clear selection criteria mentioned in Annex 2. The allocated support in this project is divided into nine communities in Salqin and Idleb sub-districts, Annex 20, and according to the numbers of small and mid-sized farmers and the number of IDPs in each targeted community. To build sufficient technical capacity and knowledge about the best agricultural practices for inter-cropping techniques, IRD is planning to support the target farmers with two practical training stages through the establishment of farmer field school FFS in the target communities. All planned activities, especially training activities, will be implemented taking into consideration all COVID-19 preventive measures prepared by the ATWG and approved by the FSL Cluster in April 2020. These measures include applying social distancing, distribution of medical gloves and masks, and ensuring that appropriate sterilization and cleaning materials are available for everyone olive farmers, women who will be involved in CFW, vendors, drivers, and project field team to avoid any infection of COVID-19.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting wheat value chain and income generating activities in Northwest Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is designed to improve the level of sustained food security in northwest Syria through supporting wheat value chain for one hectare for most vulnerable 1500 farmers (85% M, 15% F, 4% PwD, HCs and IDPs), 7500 individuals (1725M,1800F,2250B,1725G) in Sharan, Jandairis, A&#x2019;zaz&#x2019; and Aghtrin.
Targeted locations were identified based on need and market assessments (Annex 7), where assessment shows that ,many farmers moved from wheat planting as a strategic crop towards planting cash crops which provide more income.
Meetings and FGDs with local actors and farmers (males and females) will be held to explain the project goals and take any suggestions and ensure their support.
The project will achieve its objectives through a combination of five interventions:
1. Preparing farmers&#x2019; lands through supporting agriculture machine owners by contracting with them to plow the targeted farmers&#x2019; lands in order to be prepared for planting seeds
2. Providing the farmers with agriculture inputs (seeds, fertilizer, pesticides) through $250 restricted value E-voucher which maintains farmers dignity and gives them flexibility to choose the best inputs for growing wheat from a set of pre-appointed items from multiple vendors who were selected through a committee based on pre-specific criteria.
Vouchers distribution will be in Aug while the loading of balances will be done in 4 phases ($52.5 for phosphate fertilizer,$60 for seeds,$87.5 Urea fertilizer,$50 Pesticides), where balances will only be uploaded after field verification visits verify that the farmer used the received materials.
The project team will follow up the redemption process. After the end of distribution, we will conduct a PDM to measure beneficiaries satisfactory.
3. Providing farmers with theoretical and practical extension training sessions in order to strengthen their knowledge about the best practices for wheat growing which avoid environmental harm, and detecting the wheat deceases, as well as the continuous providing of consultancy services, through a team of expert agronomists, who will conduct two rounds of field visits to farmers locations in addition to following up WhatsApp groups to verify the progress of project and provide the farmers with technical advises.
4. Supporting farmers in marketing their crops through distributing packaging bags to be filled by wheat during harvest, in addition to contacting with organizations working in supporting value chain to ensure better marketing of the supported crops.
5. Supporting vulnerable CFW female workers with temporary income, through hiring 252 women for a month to assist farmers in weeding and Sunn pest management.
Takaful will ensure that the farmers will be positively involving in the project to achieve the objectives, through funding 61% of the total costs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, plowing, Packaging bags), while farmer will fund 39% (fuel for irrigation and harvesting costs).
Protection measures based on FSL cluster recommendation &#x201C;FSL Prevention and Mitigation Measures for COVID-19 on the Implementation of Agricultural Projects&#x201D; will be implemented. 
In case any problems and missing access for any of the targeted areas, we will change the location according to specific criteria in coordination with FSL Cluster, where Takaful conducted need assessment in 4 other locations.
We will ensure that the principle of Do No Harm is applied in all project&apos;s activities through markets visits, distribution monitoring and exit surveys. In addition, we will target group of women and PwD who are in charge of agricultural work, where we will take into account the difficulties of some of them related to accessing the market, where we will verify their needs and deliver items to their homes. 
We will coordinate with FSL cluster, agriculture working group, local communities and NGOs who are working in same locations, in addition to sharing the eligible locations with FSL and ER clusters to avoid any overlap</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting of self-reliance of affected households in rural of Aleppo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project endeavors to implement integrated activities in the humanitarian field in western rural of Aleppo province. This intervention will make contribution towards addressing critical food insecurity, instability and develop the essential household&#x2019;s livelihood assets through supporting the wheat value chain, access to agriculture, livestock breeders, bakeries, and IDPs/returnees. The project includes implementation of the main activities:
1. Supplementing the wheat support chain, as MASRRAT through its ongoing project is supporting 480 wheat farmers beneficiaries in Aleppo countryside, the project is funded by OCHA and will end in the July when the harvest is over, and through this intervention, it is planned to support the wheat chain by purchasing 500 kg of wheat from each beneficiary (based on specific criteria) and will be milled, as flour and bran. So, we will have approximately 80% flour equivalent to 192 tons and about 20% bran equivalent to 48-tons in order to:
A. Support the bakeries by wheat flour to produce 211.2 tons of bread to distribute it for free to 2400 families in camps and returnees for two consecutive months. MASRRAT will contract with four bakeries to increase the community participation and reduce work pressure so they do not exceed the daily production capacity.
B. As for the 48-tons of wheat bran, we will support 240 livestock breeders by distributing of 200 kg of bran for each beneficiary. Beneficiaries of livestock breeders will be the families who have (1-10 livestock) and not supported. In addition, training will be provided to livestock breeders on breeding of animals and products.
2. Improving access to agriculture by distributing of agricultural inputs for 600 beneficiaries. Every beneficiary will receive 250 kg of wheat seeds, 150 kg of composed fertilizer, 200 kg of Azote fertilizer, 1 liter of Herbicide,1 liter of Insecticide, one fuel voucher for irrigation 50 $ and harvesting costs 50 $. Moreover, the support will include provision of three technical training sessions about GAP. The beneficiaries of wheat activity will be from the local community and IDPs who settled for a while, own or renting land between 7 to10 donums suitable for wheat, as well as the farmers who meet the selection criteria. All the agricultural inputs will be purchases inside Syria in order to support the local markets.

This project will support 12951 beneficiaries affected by the Syrian crisis (3229 men, 2867 women, 3334 boys and 3521 girls) by promoting their accessibility to the humanitarian assistance significantly. All the people in the targeted villages and markets will benefit directly/indirectly from the project where the wheat and livestock production will be available in the markets at good prices. Furthermore, this intervention will improve the capacity of 2400 IDPs and returnees (men, women, children pregnant, elderly and disabled) who returned to their areas in Atareb sub-district in Aleppo and don&#x2019;t able to get sufficient quantities of bread because of poverty or inability due to lack of enough bakeries or bread distribution points. The project is designed with consideration to the cluster and WHO recommendation on prevention and mitigation measures related to COVID-19 especially during the distribution of support and conducting trainings. In addition, protection cluster recommendations were taken into consideration, wherein all the population in the targeted locations will benefit from MASRRAT protection Centers in Aleppo, in the event of any GBV referral cases.

The targeted villages in jabal Samman district - Atareb sub-districrt - are considered from the most densely populated areas: 
- Jeineh village 14.000 HHs and 5.000 IDPs 
- Atareb 50.000 HHs and 6.000 IDPs 
- Kafr Karmin 14.500 HHs and 7.500 IDPs 
- Babka 7.500 HHs and 3.500 IDPs

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support self-reliance of affected households by restoring and creating income-generating opportunities to sustain lives</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the proposed project is to enhance agricultural production, the food, and income-generating opportunities of affected households and communities in southwest Idlib especially among the most vulnerable households and communities. The proposed intervention focus on i) Improve the marketing of wheat products of farmers and support wheat/bread availability in conflict-affected regions ii) Improve the access of small livestock breeders to animal feeders iii) Restore income-generating assets amp increase agricultural production and improved economic conditions and labor market opportunities in the targeted communities. 

Over 6210 households are to be reached throughout the locations targeted by this project. At least 51% of the direct beneficiaries will be women and 5% of people with disabilities. Indirect beneficiaries are estimated at 110,000. Participation will be open to resident farmers, IDPs, and returnees with the exact ratio outlined in the proposal. 

The intervention logic assumes that agricultural development and investment in an improved value chain, in a strategic area such as wheat, can lead to increased food security, and contribute to more resilient livelihoods while equally addressing factors that compel people to migrate by creating employment opportunities, especially for vulnerable people. It is also assumed to reduce the risk of conflicts over resources and contribute to solutions to environmental degradation and climate change. 

The geographical scope of the project focuses on the southwest Idlib governorate. Indicatively the 9 following locations will be targeted: Mhambal, Shagurit, Northern Laj, Maarat Timsrin, Sarmin, Ainata, Hila, Ora Qabli - Edwan, and Acrobat.

The proposed project is building directly on an ongoing EU funded project implemented by WATAN based on mutually reinforcing effects and efficiency of the interventions along the wheat production cycle (please refer to the complementarity and exit strategy sections). It will also integrate the ongoing SCHF project in the same locations, by providing services to host communities and returnees area that is currently available to IDPs only.

Our intervention will be aligned with the wheat crop calendar and improve the purchasing power of 300 households under (output 1.1). 700 tons of wheat seeds and 600 tons of hay will be purchased 280 tons of wheat will be used as seeds for the next season&#x2019;s planting, after sifting and sterilizing by the established seeds bank. The other 420 tons of purchased wheat will be supplied to the contracted mill to be grinded, and, as a result, 336 tons of flour will be obtained and supplied to the bakery established and supported by WATAN. Consequently, bread for 1920 households can be produced and distributed free of charge (output 1.2). The remaining amount (84 tons) is used as bran to be provided along with 600 tons of hay to 2420 livestock breeders as feeders for their animals (output 2.1).

On the other hand, 1400 farmers will benefit from the distribution of wheat inputs, including seeds, fertilizers, pests control materials and harvesting costs, among which 175 farmers will receive TOT and capacity building on wheat crop integrated management through the establishment of 7 farmer field schools in the targeted areas (output 2.2). 

Moreover, 170 cash-for-work workers will be selected to implement activities related to firefighting and integrated pest management (output 2.3).

All these activities will be implemented in line with the &#x201C;Prevention and mitigation measures for COVID-19 on the implementation of agricultural projects&#x201D; that have been developed by WATAN and FSL cluster&#x2019;s partners (please refer to the risk management section).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency response to the Food Security needs of the most vulnerable conflict-affected IDPs through free bread distribution in camps in Aleppo governorate.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BINAA team has conducted a needs assessment in North Aleppo camps (Attachment 01B) in order to identify the most vulnerable camps in order to be supported by free bread distribution on a daily base for 6 months. 
After that, we conducted a second need assessment for bakeries which are closed to the selected locations and identified their capacities to prepare the daily needed amount of bread. (The bakeries need assessment is attached, Attachement 02)
We also conducted 4 focus group discussions (Attachment 03) with the local communities (2 sessions with Women and 2 sessions with men) and explained the project activities, all attendance showed their willingness in the project activities and confirmed their needs for this kind of support. After that we coordinate with the FSL cluster and the other active organization, so we selected 19 camps accordingly which are located in Aghtrin, Al Bab, Ghandorah, and Jarablus subdistricts. (The need assessment report is attached, Attachment 04)
The project aims to support 6,370 HHs (42,076 INDs: 8,704 men, 10,107 Women, 10,476 boys, 12,789 girls) by free bread distribution on average of 3 bread bundles with 600 g per family per day for 180 days. (each person will receive 300 g of bread per day)
We will select the closest bakeries to the targeted camps and supporting them by the sufficient flour and the operational cost in order to produce the needed amounts of bread and provide the identified amount of bread to the targeted camps on a daily base.
The bakeries will provide the bread to the representative in the targeted camps who will distribute the bread to the camp&apos;s population according to the identified beneficiary list. 
BINAA team will monitor the bread preparing into the bakeries and the bread distribution in order to ensure a high-quality service and high-quality production, the quality bread quality control process is attached (Attachment 05)
In the first month, BINAA will sign a MOUs with the local councils and the camps managements. After that, we will prepare the beneficiaries list in collaboration with local councils and the camp management. Then, BINAA team will conduct verification visits to all families in the targeted camps in order to identify the total family number per camp and issue the final beneficiary list, therefore the needed amount of bread per camp.
In the second month, we will release the final list for the beneficiaries, each family will receive the own card, the card will contain the essential information and the daily amount of bread, these cards will be distributed monthly. 
In parallel with the beneficiaries selection process, we will select the Flour provider and the bakeries through procurement tender while we will buy the flour from the local markets, and the bakeries will be selected from the closest locations to the targeted camps in order to ensure receiving a fresh bread by the targeted beneficiaries as well as BINAA will hire an observer in both bakeries and camps to ensure a high-quality product, high quality of transportation and equitable and safe distribution process.
BINAA will take the COVID-19 precautions in all project phases starting from beneficiary selection till the bread distribution according to BNAA COVID-19 Guidance (The BINAA COVID-19 guidance id attached, Attachment 19)</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increase the Resilience of Olive Farmers and Improve the Livelihoods Opportunities for the Conflict-affected Populations in Idleb Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to build community capacity to contribute to and benefit from this new economy, which will increase resilience of people in NWS to ongoing shocks of conflict, displacement, or the medium-term economic uncertainty. The project focuses on critical analysis of Olive Value Chain (OVC), supports livelihoods by increasing households&apos; ability to meet the needs, and encourages self-reliance. 

The project will be based in Maaret Tamsrin sub-district (Maaret Tamsrin, Haranbush, Kafr Jales, Kafr Nabi), Harim sub-district (Harim, Besnaya), and Kafr Takharim sub-district (Kafr Takharim). The project will achieve its aspired objective by supporting (OVC), in line with the COVID-19 prevention guidelines, through following package of activities:

1) 1,600 male and female olive farmers (owning between 1 to 4 dunums of land each) will receive agricultural inputs and services, extension sessions, olive harvesting and water harvesting support based on their olive orchards size to contribute to decreasing the cost of production the package of support will be:

   a. Distribution of cash voucher (25$/dunum) to support the olive farmers the voucher will cover the cost of pest management, pressing, packaging, and transportation. Approx. 4,800 dunums will be covered - on average 3 dunums per farmer.
   b. Provision of pruning tools including a hand saw, a small ax, and scissors for all selected farmers.
   c. Supporting targeted farmers with weeding amp water harvesting around olive trees and olive harvesting services through two rounds of CFW (refer to component #3).
   d. Distribution of GAP booklets to farmers

2) 40 focal points/group leaders from farmers (10% female) will receive four extension sessions about GAP and presentation skills, and will transfer the knowledge and strengthen the capacity of at least 1000 olive farmers from above target (1600 farmers). Each group leader will deliver sessions to 25 farmers. The group leaders will receive stipends - 5$ per session - to cover their transportation and launch. 

3) 2300 workers/HHs will benefit from temporary income-generating activities through CFW activities for one round of 20 days. Workers will be divided into 2 groups: the 1st group (550 workers: 500 unskilled and 50 skilled) will be for weeding and water harvesting and the 2nd (1750 workers: 1600 unskilled and 150 skilled) for olive harvesting. Approx. 60% are female, 40% are IDPs, 5% PwD and chronic illnesses. 

4) 90 participants/HHs (50% women) will benefit from small business grants the beneficiaries will be trained through six sessions about business skills. After reviewing the submitted business plans from 100 participants, selected beneficiaries (90) who meet the eligibility criteria will receive 300$ to start/restart their businesses related to the olive value chain. The business can include but not limited to food processing and olive by-products (soap and coal). The beneficiaries can submit individual or group business plans.

5) 42 technicians will benefit from a 3-month technical training program through CFW and Cash for Training (CFT) modalities as follows:
 - 30 unskilled trainees (new or undergraduate agronomists and technicians) will receive training about olive pruning, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and GAP the trainees will be paid unskilled-worker wages (6$ daily) over three rounds (60 days) and
 - 12 skilled agriculture experts/trainers (agro pharmacies owners and expert agronomists) will deliver the theoretical and practical training for the above 30 unskilled trainees for a period of three months (60 training days) including field days, site visits, coaching in agro-pharmacies. The trainers will be paid skilled-worker wages (7$ daily).

Also, distribution of soap (for COVID-19 prevention) will be conducted for the farmers and CFW workers (4 pieces per person).

In total, the project will target 4072 unique HHs, 20360 individuals: M 4479, W 4886, B 5701,G 5294</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Multi-sectoral emergency assistance for vulnerable people in Euphrates Shield Area and Afrin</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is linked to the OPS project HSYR20-FSCSHLWSH. WHH intends to deliver immediate support to people in need in the Euphrates Shield area and Afrin. The proposed intervention has three components: (1) distribution of multi-sectoral (FSL-WASH-SNFI) vouchers to internally displaced persons (IDPs) living in camps and unconditional cash assistance to the most vulnerable (2) Cash for Work (CfW) activities to enhance the hygiene in camps and (3) COVID-19 awareness campaigns in the camps.The first component of the project aims at covering the basic needs of IDPs in camps in the areas of food security, NFI and hygiene through multi-sectoral vouchers, unconditional cash assistance and CfW activities. 
Vouchers: 
Beneficiaries will be able to redeem the food, nonfood and hygiene items from a list based on nutritional dietary and basic personal hygiene needs. The voucher value will be 120$ per  HH per month and each HH will receive it for eight months. The activity will take place in two locations, one in Afrin and one in Azaz, and in each one 487 HHs will be targeted. In total, 975 HHs will benefit from the activity. The distribution will take place in IDP camps through blanket distribution. Vendors will be selected based on the proximity to the settlements and their supply capacity as well as the quality and price of items. 
Cash for Work: 
Regarding CfW activities 300 people will be selected to work for 96 days each with a salary of 1.9 USD per day. The main purpose of this activity is to increase the financial liquidity of the most vulnerable camp population to enable them to meet their basic food needs and to enhance the hygiene in camps by cleaning the streets, irrigation systems and open channels. Furthermore, 30 of the most  vulnerable disabled people and widows who don&#x2019;t have a person at home to work will be selected to receive the assistance unconditionally. 
To complement this, the third component aims at increasing COVID-19/hygiene awareness in the IDP camps. Taking into account women empowerment, female camp members will be selected from the same camps and trained as hygiene mobilizers and develop a hygiene awareness campaign plan in the TOT. The TOT will also cover protection issues, allowing the mobilizers to recognize protection cases and act on them. This activity will also take place in two cycles in each one 20 women will be identified and trained followed by the implementation of the hygiene awareness campaign plan over a period of three months. It is targeted at women specifically, as they are mostly the ones who take care of the children and the hygiene and sanitation of the settlement places. Also considering female hygiene needs, women are more vulnerable. In a second step, the hygiene mobilizers will be sharing the information they learnt in the training by implementing the awareness campaign, which will include household visits inside their camps. Lastly, they will reflect on their experiences and gather lessons learnt in a report. They will also have the chance to reflect on their experiences and discuss lessons learnt in a one-day-session with the trainer of the TOT in a follow-up session after performing the HH visits. The hygiene mobilizers will receive incentives for their work.
By training and engaging female hygiene mobilizers from among the target population WHH supports further engagement and participation of women in the humanitarian response. In order to create a combination where people in need will be able to redeem hygiene items through the vouchers and learn practical knowledge on hygiene, both components address the same target group. The selection of camps will be based on humanitarian principles, where the most vulnerable camps will be targeted based on the less access they have to food, nonfood and hygiene items. The project will be implemented inside IDP camps since the people living there had to leave their belongings behind, which puts them into a more vulnerable position</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting the Provision of Life-Saving and Life-Sustaining Healthcare Services for the Conflict Affected Population in Need Within Harim District.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the SCHF 2020 SA1 allocation- health cluster objectives, and in response to the demonstrated needs and gaps in health service provision for the conflict- affected population within Harim district, Human Appeal (HA) proposes to support the functionality of three healthcare facilities in the district for a duration of 9 months, namely:
	&#x201C;Iman&#x201D; maternity hospital in Sarmada/ Dana sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: G0703086): Supported from HA direct fund since November 2019.
	Human Appeal Mobile Clinic in Sarmada IDPs camps/ Dana sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: B0200196): Operated by HA since November 2019 through funding provided by a partner external to OCHA. However, the fund will end by the 31st of May 2020.
	&#x201C;Samidoon&#x201D; IDP camp primary healthcare PHC center in Little Hir Jamus/ Salqin sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: G0703016): Lacking support since the 10th of January 2020 and has since been operated on voluntarily basis by its staff in coordination with IHD.

The above facilities will be providing primary and secondary healthcare services for people in need within their individual catchment areas as follows:
	RH outpatient consultations (All three facilities).
	Pediatric outpatient consultations (All three facilities).
	General medicine outpatient consultations (HA MC and &#x201C;Samidoon&#x201D;).
	Community health awareness services (All three facilities).
	Provision of essential medicines (All three facilities).
	Referral capacity (&#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital and HA MC only).
	CEmONC services, laboratory services, inpatient healthcare for the women of reproductive age and newborns (&#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital only).
	MHPSS and basic trauma care services (&#x201C;Samidoon&#x201D; PHC center).

Besides referring to the health cluster/ Turkey hub dashboard health facilities map, and for the purpose of ensuring coordinated and non-duplicating intervention, HA, during the design phase, was very keen to coordinate and communicate with the partners and coordination bodies relevant to project including Idleb health directorate, SRH TWG, and Sham foundation as being operating a pediatric specialized hospital in Sarmada, the same community where &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital is based (Communication are attached). 

In addition to the above service package, and to ensure integration of COVID-19 related preparedness and response measure, HA proposes to establish and operate COVID-19 triage stations at the entry of both &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital and &#x201C;Samidoon&#x201D; PHC center for a duration of 3 months during the overall project implementation period depending on the situation on the ground, particularly confirming any case of COVID-19 in NW- Syria (However, this component is subject to modification if needed as per the feedback by the relevant reviewing individuals/ committees from the health cluster and OCHA ends in case this application qualifies for further reviews). 

In order to support directing the use of the allocation- matched funds for the purpose of directly serving the targeted population, It&#x2019;s imperative to mention that HA will provide co-funding of around 175,000 USD planned to support the provision of all medicines, medical and lab supplies required at all three facilities, rehabilitation costs of &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital, and provision of the majority of project support staff remuneration costs needed for ensuring the smooth implementation of the proposed activities and provision of the planned healthcare services.

With the above details alongside the planned indicator targets, beneficiaries to be reached and the consideration of the total costs proposed to be matched to this allocation, the cost per medical procedure matched to this application will be less than 7 USD and considering HA co-fund, it will be around 8.5 USD, where both values are considered to be highly efficient against the average cost of around 10-12 USD across NW- Syria.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Syria is soon entering its ninth year of violent and devastating conflict, with the situation in the Northern provinces dramatically worsening and hospitals frequently becoming targets of attacks. Moreover, with several hundred thousand people reportedly displaced and one of the largest influxes of IDPs reported in the region, the situation is becoming increasingly acute as health facilities are greatly overstrained and medical resources are missing. A potential COVID19 outbreak would have to accelerate devastating effects and further amplify the dire needs in the health sector while putting a great risk on the continuation of essential interventions. As of now, secondary healthcare services fall over 60% short of the benchmark (for a more detailed account see the needs assessment section).

This project aims to provide lifesaving and limb-saving health care services to more than 150,000 individuals (indirect beneficiaries). This will be done through the provision of out-patient clinics, an emergency department, and surgical operating rooms at Alamal Hospital. This project will complete the infrastructure of the hospital facilities, contracting the medical staff, and offering both diagnostic and therapeutic supplies, to fill the gap in secondary health care in the area of orthopedics, and offer a specialized center with an on-call vascular surgeon. This will ultimately result in a decreasing rate of amputation and the complication of trauma. Aligned to the first objective of the health cluster for 2020 of ensuring the continuity of essential healthcare services, especially during the COVID19 pandemic, this project is addressing this objective with orthopedic treatments being identified as a greatly needed essential healthcare service and is also in line with the priority workshop result in early 2020 which a decision to focus on investing in the development of existing health facility than creating new ones. In the face of a potential outbreak of COVID-19, orthopedic patients will have even harder access to the dignified treatment needed and with their conditions gradually deteriorating, this will have severe negative future consequences in terms of hospital facilities and medical equipment but also in terms of the affected peoples&#x2019; self-reliance, resilience, and economic participation. The affected groups risk being further pushed into vulnerability and marginalization. 

This overall objective of this project is to support &#x201C;Al Amal Hospital&#x201D; to improve the accessibility of essential orthopedic and trauma specialized health services in Salqin sub-district for both IDPs and the host community. The specific objectives of the project are to:
(1) Decrease the morbidity and mortality among the trauma and orthopedic cases in the sub-district of Salqin
(2) Maintain the hospital services available during the COVID19 pandemic and ensure filling the gap in the area.
(3) Strengthen the infrastructure of the facility to include the essential equipment and supplies.
(4) Building the technical capacity of health workers. 

About 23,285 direct and 150,000 indirect beneficiaries are targeted by the intervention, whereby at least 40% of direct beneficiaries will be women, 7% will be people with disabilities. he geographical scope of the project will be Salqin- Harim- Idlib where more than 300K individuals are currently residing. 

The intervention logic assumes that improving the accessibility to life-saving and life-sustaining secondary healthcare and the capacity and infrastructure of hospitals in the field of orthopedic and trauma in Salqin sub-district will contribute to the reduction of mortality and morbidity rates and contribute to communities living self-reliant and dignified lives, while sustainably freeing up limited hospital and health care capacities in the long run. 

Name of the facility:
Al Amal orthopedic hospital: [HeRAMS CODE: G0703142]</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support IDA blood bank and Thalassemia center as well as the internal department of Wasim Maaz Hospital in Azaz, Aleppo governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The resilience of local communities and the health system in northwest Syria has weakened considerably during the last few months with the relentless military offensive by the Government of Syria and its allies, which began in December 2019. This has forcibly displaced around 1 million people towards the closed Turkish border in the north, with gt68 health facilities attacked between April 2019 and February 2020 according to recent research (attached with title COVID 19 response in northwest Syria). The project aims at supporting IDA blood bank and Thalassemia center B0204072 as well as the internal department of Wasim Maaz Hospital in Aleppo governorate, Azaz district, Azaz sub-district, Azaz community C1654 (HeRAMS code: !B0204006). The blood bank in Azaz supports 10 health facilities in the area with blood bags. The Sphere Standards for Blood Collection and Laboratory Practice for Blood and Blood Products will be taken into account and complied with during the implementation of the activities. Three testing procedures will be used to ensure the safety of the blood collected. The maximum storage period (33 days) is continuously monitored, infected, or expired blood is disposed of in existing incinerators and medical waste disposal pits. A loss of 12% of the blood donated can be expected, which must be classified as unsafe and destroyed. A total of 4 blood products will be generated: Erythrocyte concentrate, blood serum, platelets, and whole blood. In Azaz district and surrounding areas, there are 
The two facilities are ongoing and active and play a key role in supporting IDPs in camps and the Host community population in the whole area of northern Aleppo. 
Azaz area, where the two proposed facilities are located, are considered safe areas which make them a resort for the newly displaced people. Thus, supporting the proposed facilities will be a response to the acute health needs in the areas.
The internal department in the hospital will be supported, both inpatient and outpatient wards. Through this project, medical consultations in general medicine, endocrinology, cardiology, gastroenterology, and hematology, as well as medicine distribution and referral services from Syria to Turkey and within Syria, will be delivered to people in need, focusing on the most vulnerable groups, including elderly persons, reproductive-aged women, and chronically-ill patients.
To better respond to COVID-19 and for waste management and disposal, IDA has developed a list of items that were procured for most of IDA health facilities. IDA follows specific guidelines for waste management and disposal.
In fact, the blood bank of Azaz is an existing facility that was supported by a donor and the grant has ended. IDA had been reporting to the health cluster on the Blood Bank of A&apos;zaz. To improve the quality of delivered services, and due to the damage of some devices, IDA identified a set of devices and consumables to be procured under this grant if it was approved. procuring some of these items, not all of them, will jeopardize the quality of delivered services. IDA has developed a COVID-19 response plan of IDA that will be implemented across IDA health facilities in northern Syria. The response plan was derived from WHO taskforce response plan with similar objectives. IDA has already communicated with several partners and donors to fund the COVID-19 preparedness and response plan of IDA. The target facilities in this project are already covered by the necessary equipment and materials for COVID-19 PRP. IDA PRP for COVID-19 was shared with the health cluster previously.
According to the recent estimations from northern Aleppo, the number of registered Thalassemia patients was 108 in March 2020 who will be target by this project</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting Quality Secondary and Reproductive Health Care Services in NWS.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SEMA, under the direct support of SCHF, seeks to maintain the introduction of health services, and to continue the essential life-saving interventions including: critical inpatient therapies, reproductive health services, in addition to maintain the availability of essential medication and supplies.
To reach this end, SEMA proposes to support Jisr Ash-Shugur and Al-Ikha&apos;a hospital, in Jisr Ash-Shugur and Dana sub-districts, and thus ensuring the provision of secondary, and reproductive health care to people in need, as the two hospitals are located in under-served areas, whose people are suffering from the lack of medical services and are having difficult living conditions.
SEMA tries to respond to the critical needs of newly displaced population and to address the most urgent gaps by supporting Al-Ikha&apos;a hospital for 12 months and thus ensure the availability of its services, in addition to support Jisr Ash-Shugur hospital for five months.
Jisr- alshoghour hospital:(HeRAMS code: G0704013):
A trauma and surgical hospital, serving a population of 70k in Jisr Ash-Shugur city and surrounding areas including the most vulnerable groups (IDPs, women, children and the elderly) will have access to the following services: OPD (General, Orthopedic), IPD, surgeries, emergency, surgical ward, lab, X-Ray, pharmacy, as the hospital contains 20 beds and two operation theaters.
This hospital was supported by WHO till 15th of March 2020 through SEMA, and currently out of support, it was supposed to be supported by other partner at the beginning of April, but this partner apologized due to funding, and it is now a priority (according to IHD).
Al-Ikha&apos;a hospital:(CEmONC) (HeRAMS code:G0703071):
It is a maternity and childhood hospital in Atmeh (Harim District), and considered as the most major facility in the area, which is crowded with IDPs (total population of 250k IDPs in Atmeh). The hospital has been supported by SEMA through several grant&apos;s since 5 years, and will be out of funding after 20th of June 2020.
Al-Ikha&apos;a hospital includes the following departments:
pediatric and neonatal Department: Provides pediatric consultations and neonatal health care services and equipped with operating new-born incubators. 
Inpatient Department: Where major and minor surgeries are implemented, in addition to the hospitalization of patients. 
ER Department: Where all trauma cases are received and provided with emergency services, then referred to the needed specialty. 
Laboratory: The hospital contains a well-equipped lab to perform the needed tests for the beneficiaries in the hospital. 
X-Ray Department: The hospital contains a well-equipped x-ray department with a variety of different services.
It is worth-mentioning that waste management and disposal in Al-Ikha&apos;a hospital is applied by collecting the medical waste and transporting it for about 50 K from Atma to the incinerator in Idleb. This process is occurred ten times per month where this grant will secure the cost of transportation.
Both hospitals are critical and crucial to their areas, and SEMA has coordinated with IHD to prioritize them for any coming opportunity to support.
Due to the very volatile environment and the development of novel COVID-19, SEMA managed to be flexible in responding to the immediate and urgent needs on the ground, so a dynamic and strong risk management strategy and plan &quot;B&quot; is already set up based on the security developments in the area where activating mobile clinics to reach the elderly and vulnerable cases (people with chronic diseases), in addition to tele-medicine component where some consultations related to COVID-19 and others may be introduced via phone to avoid gatherings.
Moreover, As SEMA always tries to acheive long-term impact and to leave the community in much-stronger case, so the project team will conduct training for the two hospital staff about: BLS, ATLS, resuscitation of new born, COVID19 detection and referral pathway.</narrative>

The project will create 156 income-generating jobs for 159 most vulnerable HHs (125 males, 34 females) in the targeted camps through CFW activities which will improve the infrastructure and environment in the targeted camps. Workers will pave the pathways around the tents (21770 m2) with the stone that will be broken and shaped in nearby lands to the targeted camps, this will improve the lands which stones are taken from as it will reform the lands and make it more suitable for agricultural activities, and will strengthen the social integration between the host community&quot; landlords of surrounded lands&quot; and IDPs. Paving the pathways will improve the winterization conditions for IDPs in the targeted camps as it will allow them to walk in dry pathways, not in muddy ones, and mitigate the effects of the floods, especially that BINAA is currently establishing a rainwater drainage system in the targeted camps.

BINAA and through their experienced team will handle workshops operation and beneficiaries work, in addition to purchasing primary items and then selling the produced items in contractual me methodology as per BINAA policies. For this purpose, a committee will be formed to handle workshop operations, all sewing machines and equipment ownership will go to the beneficiaries themselves at the end of the project in a contractual manner which protects their rights under camp management supervision.  
Furthermore, the project will provide life-saving services for IDP sites HHs which will be moved to the mentioned camps through provision of heating fuel and stoves during the winter season to 1,555 conflict affected IDPs HHs (7,775 individuals) (1788 women, 1555 men, 2333 girls and 2099 boys).
Each family will receive 320 liters of fuel packed in jerry cans, in addition to stove, specification is attached to the proposal.
The fuel will be distributed in 3 batches, starting in November 2020, and ending in January 2021.The distribution will be in kind, the protection measures related to the COVID will be followed in addition to gender considerations during the distribution process, please see attachment 19 (COVID Binaa guidance).

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency assistance to conflict-affected communities in North West Syria to cover the core and essential NFI items and winter needs though Multipurpose Cash Assistance (MPCA)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The scale, severity and complexity of the humanitarian situation and needs in North West Syria (NWS), exacerbated by continuous inter-factional fighting, lawlessness and government military offensives over the past 9 years, have caused an unprecedented number of civilian deaths and largescale population displacement. As of 5 March 2020, when the Russia-Turkey ceasefire was announced, Idleb has seen relative calm, however, the looming threat of a COVID-19 outbreak and renewed fighting remains. 

Since 1 December 2019, almost 1 million people have been displaced from the southern parts of Idleb and Western Aleppo. This raised the total number of displaced people in NWS to 2.84 million (CCCM Snapshot update of 8 March 2020 and Population Overview of NWS of 6 March 2020.). The hostilities impact heavily on civilians who have already endured multiple displacements and years of violence. This has further strained host communities in terms of non-food items (NFIs), winter needs, food, shelter, and protection needs. The winter months signify increased seasonal needs among the most vulnerable. 

GOAL has extensive experience in cross-border humanitarian operations in NWS, including through its well established and agile rapid response mechanism the North Syria Response Facility (NSRF), through which in-kind and cash assistance contributed by a range of institutional donors is pre-positioned, enabling GOAL to provide a rapid, appropriate and needs-based multi-modality response to shocks such as displacement. GOAL&#x2019;s winter response is also delivered through the NSRF.

GOAL is proposing an action to provide life-saving and life-sustaining shelter and NFI support across three sub-districts in Idleb and North Aleppo governorates - A&#x2019;zaz, Qourqeena, Salqin. The selected locations have been coordinated, agreed and confirmed with the SNFI cluster.

Provision of core and essential NFIs
Using the NSRF, GOAL proposes an action of emergency MPCA distribution to cover the needs of affected displaced households (HHs) to purchase core and essential NFIs. Each HH will receive $100 in line with NFI monetization guidance developed by the Shelter and Non-Food Item (SNFI) Cluster and Cash Working Group (CWG). 1,000 HHs/5,000 individuals will benefit from provision of MPCA to cover core and essential NFIs

Provision of seasonal and supplementary NFIs including heating fuel
Under the winterization component, GOAL aims to provide additional support to its vulnerable food security beneficiaries to meet increased needs during the cold winter months using a cash-based response, thus reducing reliance on negative coping strategies. Under this component, 3,600 HHs/18,000 individuals will benefit from provision of $120 of MPCA to cover seasonal and supplementary NFIs including heating fuel. The cash transfer value is decided based on GOAL&#x2019;s experience in winter response and coordination between the SNFI Cluster and the CWG, with SNFI Cluster guidance indicating that $120 will be enough to cover approximately 60 of the coldest days of heating fuel needs with 4 litres per HH/day. GOAL will aim to complete the winter response by the end of December 2020.

As in last year&#x2019;s winter response, GOAL will coordinate beneficiary selection criteria with the SNFI Cluster and the CWG and will include HHs headed by women, minors, persons with disabilities, the elderly, and HHs in mountainous areas with high snow coverage, extreme temperatures, or high winter needs.

The proposed subdistricts for the winter response have been selected based on high levels of need, gaps in NFI response, SNFI Cluster priorities, and GOAL&#x2019;s access. GOAL will coordinate the specific sub-district(s) where the response will take place once the SNFI Cluster coordination team shares the priority locations for 2020 winter responses. GOAL has access to all of the above-mentioned subdistricts.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhance shelter conditions for the most vulnerable groups of IDPs</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is oriented to serve the most vulnerable groups from those were forced to flee out of their places in southern Idlib and western Aleppo governorates between December 2019 and March 2020.

Tracking the last waves of IDPs, most of them have managed to find a safer place away from the front lines. Part of them is living now either in unfinished/partially damaged, or inadequate collective centres which lack the basics needs of daily living standards, such as privacy, dignity, and minimum health requirements.

This project is planned to improve the shelter conditions of the displaced people to improve their living standards and ensure that the provided assistance will be free for all the targeted beneficiaries for one year of safe and dignified conditions, and the activities will include:

1- Provide rehabilitation services for 1,500 IDP households living in 34 collective centres without any appropriate living conditions. (Afrin - Al-Bab - Azaz - Idleb - Dana - Maaret Tamsrin - Sarmada - Armanaz - Salqin - Azmarin)
&quot;Rehabilitation works will include a portion assigned for maintaining and improving the current sanitation facilities of the targeted collective centres&quot;.
2- Provide NFI/CRI kits to 1,500 vulnerable households who are covered within the previous rehabilitation services. (secured fund from WATAN complementary project)
3- Provide complementary winterization assistance including Stoves, and Heating materials from WATAN secure funded activities.
4- Provide awareness support (Banners - Posters - Painted Illustrations on the public facilities) on COVID19 awareness, fire risks, safety, security and PSAE awareness.

&quot;Prior to any technical works or verification process, WATAN team will identify the needs of the collective centres and share it back with Shelter/NFI cluster for the final approval or revision, and then go forward if approved or reallocate with other vulnerable locations inline with cluster strategies and recommendations&quot;.

As for the beneficiaries, WATAN already conducted a need assessment and a 100% verification including a specific scoring system that can identify the targeted groups of this project, meanwhile, the provided support will keep seeking to support the shelter capacity and to seek longer-term solutions that can be provided to the affected groups by reallocation households from the camps to the rehabilitated collective centres as well.

The technical needs will be assessed through specialist teams consists of engineers and technicians, and based on their findings, the fund will be allocated to fill the gaps of lacking the basic needs. Bill of quantities will be prepared accordingly, and the implementation will go through contractual services after a tight bidding process.

By these mentioned activities, the provision of longer-term shelter and NFI support in the collective centres will support a better preparedness to the upcoming winter response as well as strengthening the elements of preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Prioritize the most affected communities and coordinate with the active humanitarian actors to secure the basic services to the most vulnerable people, this intervention is designed to meet the needs of women, girls, people with disabilities and elders, with an adequate lifesaving life-sustaining services.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project&#x2019;s proposed interventions seek to improve the humanitarian situation for the affected population in Northern Aleppo by implementing light and medium rehabilitation of 1,000 houses (Afrin, Mare, and Jandairis communities), besides,Mukaveme camp extension in Shmarekh community which will provide adequate shelter for 300 HHs.
6,500 BNFs will benefit directly from all the shelter interventions.

 1,000 houses are rehabilitated with light/medium rehabilitation activities (600 light $350.00 AVG / 400 medium $800.00 AVG):
Afrin (200 HHs), as a continuation to the ongoing SCHF project where IRD has received more than 1000 requests for rehabilitation but the project target was only 550, Mare (500 HHs), and Jandairis (300 HHs)
30,400 m2 construction of infrastructure (Graveling) in Mukaveme Camp, Shmarekh, to accommodate 300 HHs

The houses rehabilitation activities will mainly focus on:

- Ensuring internal living spaces&#x2019; security and privacy by providing closed, sealed and independent environments for the HH
- Ensuring the maximum beneficiaries&apos; safety
- Ensuring a healthier environment by promoting hygiene and maintaining the WASH facilities in the houses
- Providing illumination and a light power source in each room
- Ensuring better living conditions for people with special needs
IRD will target both IDP and HC households in the rehabilitation activities (IDP 70% HC 30%), those who live in inadequate shelter, especially where minimum SPHERE standards are not met (3.5m2/individual)

As the cluster rehabilitation guidelines for houses with light level of damage (Grade 1), IRD will not interfere with any action that might change the house&#x2019;s specifications and the house&#x2019;s budget will not exceed $400 with no constructional works. Regarding houses with medium level of damage (Grade 2), IRD will do the needed repairs as long as the house is not putting the occupants under danger and HLP standards are met

IRD will sign a coordination document with the BNFs to ensure their right to stay inhabitant in the shelter for at least one year after the date of the rehabilitation work completion.
All BNFs&#x2019; approvals on the terms of assistance are mandatory and the MoU with the LCs will be signed accordingly
Mukaveme Camp infrastructure construction activity will focus on:
- Removing obstacles and leveling the land
- Strengthen the land with backfilling materials
- Graveling the site, to leave the site in the best shape possible for the housing units&#x2019; construction by IHH, taking in consideration minimum sphere amp SNFI cluster standards
- IRD coordinated with IHH and AFAD to implement the construction of infrastructure activity in Mukaveme camp extension after completing the first extension in March 2020, ANNEX 25.
All other required activities are going to be conducted by IHH or its partners in coordination with AFAD, such as the latrines construction, sanitation, drainage, and water systems, electricity system, NFI distributions, fencing etc.

Coordination at all levels and with all stakeholders will be continuous throughout the project duration, and the implementation will be monitored and eventually evaluated to ensure the best application of the implementation methods and to gradually improve work quality. Implementation Plan ANNEX 01.
All activities will be implemented taking in consideration the SNFI cluster&#x2019;s recommendations for COVID-19, especially in: registration points, dealing with BNFs, contractors, workers and IRD staff (physical distancing, sanitizers, masks and gloves, replacing pens, raising awareness banners in a visible place and a suitable hand-washing point at each site)
IRD coordinated with each of Bonyan, Binaa, and SDI as they declared their intention to apply for shelter activity for the same allocation, there was no overlapping either in activities or locations
Coordination emails are in ANNEX 26-27-28.
IRD identified Suran sub-district as the relocation plan&apos;s target if needed</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lifesaving emergency and winter support through Cash and GIK distribution for the newly displaced and returnees in NWS.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">the project at hand aims to contribute to the emergency amp winter response by applying a flexible approach that allows Violet to cover the needs in a timely manner and appropriate modality. it aims to help the most vulnerable coping with the displacement amp harsh winter conditions through implementing the following activities
1. &#x650;&#x650;Addressing the needs of 3166 HHs for essential NFIs by the distribution of new arrival kits and/or cash for NFIs (120$). the new arrival kit was designed based on the SNFI cluster guidance and cash amount was designed based on the SMEB

2. provision One-off winter cash (180$) provision for 3000 HHs. The winterization cash amount was designed based on the SNFI cluster guidance but also based on the lessons learned from previous projects to cover heating fuel needs of 5-members HH (4 liters of fuel/day) for 60 days in the winter.  while designing the cash amount, Violet took considered the fuel price differences between winter and summer ( according to REACH,  average fuel price in the last winter was 0.75 USD, while the average price in summer is 0.45 USD). The cash value was discussed with CWG and SNFI. However, Violet will adopt the SNFI and CWG recommendations in case of any change. winterization cash will also contribute to mitigating the risk of storing fuel for a long time by BNF. Additionally, based on the WASH cluster recommendations, each BNF HH will receive 750 g of soap sufficient for 1 month to contribute to COVID-19 response

Cash modality was selected to allow BNFs to secure their needs in a dignified and flexible way. Moreover, it contributes to market recovery through disposing of cash in the market and may create new job opportunities
the project will focus on the newly IDPs in the areas that have been identified with the highest needs, and hosting newly IDPs who fled their homes as a result of GOS offensive, but also the returnees and IDPs who returned to their original communities, or communities of displacement. moreover, winter cash support will be implemented in the areas with a high percentage of damaged shelters like Sarmin, Ariha amp Atareb (According to HNAP report for April 2020) since the IDPs and returnees who living in damaged buildings are the most vulnerable and not protected against the harsh winter conditions.
both groups will be targeted as they are the most vulnerable groups to the shocks. BNFs will be nominated by the community representatives based on the selection criteria including displacement and returning duration taking into account prioritizing women-headed HHs, HHs with children, elderlies, PWD, pregnant, and lactating women
Violet will ensure close coordination with the other actors and SNFI/ CCCM clusters to ensure the coordinated response and to avoid potential overlapping. it also confirms its readiness to immediately start the implementation as soon as the SGA is signed since it is in the final stage of contracting with the new arrival kits supplier, and also has FWA for MTA services and transportation, which will be utilized under this project. The contractors and MTA have been identified through competitive bidding process based on their experience, accessibility, and financial offer.
While the NFI kits and cash coupons will be distributed by Violet teams, the MTA will be responsible for redeeming the BNFs coupons. Before cash distribution, RNA, and market assessment in terms of availability of the NFIs, their prices, and the accessibility will be conducted to ensure the markets are functioning and all BNFs have good and equal access markets. 
In order to ensure the selection criteria are respected and to avoid terrorism financing, fraud, and Forgery, cash coupons will be equipped with light thermal stickers. Moreover,  the verification and antiterrorism check (ATC) will be conducted for all cash BNFs
Finally, Violet will ensure the COVID-19 preventive measures, accountability and SEA mitigation measures are applied.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving Living Conditions of the Conflict-affected Population in Northwest Syria through NFI and Winterization Assistance.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to respond to the needs of conflict-affected IDPs and the most vulnerable people of the host community (70% IDPs and 30% host community) in Idleb and Afrin districts, by providing life-saving NFI and winterization assistance through the following components: 

a) providing vulnerable 1000 households (5000 individuals approx.) in Afrin and Janderes sub-districts with in-kind essential Non-Food Item kits that will include the following materials chosen based on the S/NFI Cluster guidance: plastic sheets, jerry cans, solar lamps, sleeping mats, blankets, and hasira/carpet. The procurement of the NFI kits will be done in Turkey, and this will avoid impacting the local markets and any potential increase of local prices. This component will mainly target IDPs who have not received any similar assistance during the last displacement. This component will be implemented during the first three months of the project (distribution, including procurement, to take place in July-September period). 

b) distribution of restricted vouchers for heating fuel needed during the winter season in 2020 in Afrin, and Janderes in Aleppo governorate and Kafr Takharim, Armanaz and Maaret Tmisreen in Idleb. Winterization activity will target 2800 HHs (14,000 individuals) of both IDPs (70%) and HCs (30%) with 2 restricted vouchers for two rounds during winter months (December 2020 and January 2021) total value of the vouchers will be 120 USD (two vouchers: each with 60 USD value). This was determined based on the SNFI winter guidance and coordination with and preference of the SNFI Cluster, where the average need per household in NWS is 4 L of fuel daily, or 10 kg of coal per day for continuous 60 days minimum. This will ensure reaching more beneficiaries during the harsh winter season. Shafak will conduct an assessment in the targeted locations to identify the type of stoves the targeted beneficiaries are using to determine the suitable type of heating fuel (diesel, or charcoal), and contract with suppliers accordingly. As for voucher printing, it will be procured from Turkey, and transferred to Syria (transfer of goods to the final delivery point, Shafak office in Bab Al-Hawa, will be a condition in the contracts with the printing vendors, who use commercials border crossings - Shafak already has experience in such procurement). The modality of restricted vouchers has been chosen to ensure that targeted beneficiaries will use the vouchers only for intended assistance (fuel/charcoal for heating). 

c) Distribution of soap bars (six pieces - 125g each) to enhance beneficiaries&apos; prevention against COVID-19 these items will be distributed along with each of the above components.

In total, this project intends to reach 3800 households (19000 individuals:  4,470 men,  4,886 women,  4,470 boys, 5,175 girls) focusing on IDP sites such as unfinished buildings, collective centers and informal settlements. Shafak selected these communities based on the following: a) IDPs movement tracking, b) accessibility, c) safety and d) needs identified by Shafak. Shafak will prioritize the most vulnerable groups (e.g. women-headed HHs, HHs with members with chronic diseases, elderlies, ...etc. refer to the attached selection criteria. 

The beneficiaries will be selected based on a set of vulnerability criteria with a focus on the newly IDPs who left their hometowns during the last displacement and are in dire need of winterization and NFI assistance.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve the living conditions of conflict-affected populations through repairing of damaged houses and providing winterization needs while enhancing referral mechanisms to ensure accessibility and privacy for vulnerable groups in NW Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project contributes to life-sustaining assistance to the most vulnerable groups in Northwest Syria Idleb governorate sub-districts of Dana and Qourqeena through the following two interventions that designed based on attached Need Assessment (Attachment.1):

Firstly, provision house repairing for /600/ of partly damaged houses&#x2014;Grade 2 for the IDPs and host communities (include 782 men, 836 women, 664 boys, and 718 girls). HLP due diligence will be included in implementation in order to achieve as much legal certainty about tenure as possible to ensure the security of tenure by verifying the ownership of the land or shelter and to prevent the exploitation and eviction of the IDPs. The percentage of IDPs will be 60%, and the rest will be from the host communities. Contractor- modality will be adopted of repairing houses, this modality supports an accountable, timely, and efficient use of resources while protecting the rights of the beneficiaries.

Secondly, provision winterization assistance (diesel stoves with accessories, diesel fuel) for the most vulnerable people 1350 HHs (include 1755 men, 1890 women, 1485 boys, and 1620 girls), 80% of the IDPs who living (outside camps) in the makeshift shelter or in damaged/unfinished buildings and they did not receive winter assistance in the past, also 20% of them host communities who meet the vulnerability criteria to avoid the sensitive. All the beneficiaries will be selected based on the vulnerability criteria, so the blanket distributions will be avoided.  The in-kind- modality will be adopted for distributions of the fuel and stoves. Diesel fuel was chosen for heating because it is the most common and available in the targeted areas, it is most efficient and relatively safe, so vulnerable HHs can install the stoves and use it easily, also it will be useful in cooking food in addition to heating. SRD will purchase them from local markets for revitalization, and will be responsible for quality control.

During the life of the project, SRD outreach workers will ensure that all vulnerable groups are involved in project activities, and will accompany the shelter teams during the door to door verification to detect of vulnerability cases in the beneficiaries&apos; houses and refer them to nearby SRD community centers to respond (Attachment.2). In addition, they will ensure that technical assessments conducted by shelter teams meet the demand of persons with disabilities and the elderly. Also, they will deliver awareness messages for beneficiaries who receiving the winterization assistance to protect from COVID-19 and ensuring that the distribution process in line with protection principles.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing emergency nutrition, health, and protection services for displaced children under 5 and PLWs by establishing 8 RRTs in addition to one OTP</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will cover 85,000 people, disaggregated as follows:
- 29,750 PLWs
- 55,250 Children under 5

One OTP center and 8 rapid response teams (RRTs) will be maintained and will continue to provide services in 
Idleb gt Idleb gt Maaret Tamsrin gt Kelly (OTP)
Idleb gt Harim gt Dana gt Qah (RRTs)

Each Rapid response team (RRT) will work in specific locations and will cover (pregnant and lactating women and children under 5)

These Rapid response teams will work in parallel and in coordination with the available health facilities in the target areas. The RRTs will provide integrated health, nutrition, child protection, and hygiene promotion.

Nurses will screen the children under 5 and refer the ones with dangers signs and medical problems to the available health facilities.

Community Health Workers (CHWs) will assess and screen nutritional status among the children under 5 and distribute nutritional supplies to them where needed. Also, the infant and young child feeding practices in emergencies (IYCF-E) services will be provided to prevent any case of malnutrition by:

- Counseling the PLWs and caregivers of children under 24 months of age and providing messages on IYCF-E recommended practices to mothers who have malnourished children. 
- Distributing micronutrients and nutrition supplies for the PLWs and children.
- Reporting to the cluster any distribution of breast milk substitute.

Midwives will screen pregnant and lactating women and refer the ones with any danger signs or medical problems to the nearest facilities. 

Also, a pre and rapid coordination combined with referrals will be in place if the team notices or identifies any sign of abuse or violence among children under 5 and or mothers. All cases of violence against women and children will be referred to a pre-identified center.

Continue to support the OTP center in Kelly PHC Maaret Tamsrin.
This facility will provide treatment of severe acute malnutrition (without complications) for all boys and girls under 5 and IYCF counseling will be provided to their mothers. 
This response will adopt the recommendation of the cluster in COVID-19 context to minimize the risk of infection for staff and beneficiaries through:

- Mercy-USA will apply recommended IPC measures at RRTs sites 
- IYCF-E counseling and messages could be conducted via WhatsApp 
- Screen and isolate all beneficiaries with suspected COVID-19 at entrance point of OTP site. 
-Dissemination of information on COVID-19 signs, symptoms and IPC measures 
-All other needed measures will apply according to the cluster recommendation 

Also, this project will involve empowering mothers and HH members through training to screen their own children for malnutrition by teaching them how to use color-coded Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) tapes and check for oedema.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of life-saving Nutrition services for the PIN through 1 stabilization center and RRTs in Dana subdistrict</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The arrival of about 840,000 IDPs to the areas near the Syrian-Turkish border has resulted an insufficient access to curative and preventive nutrition services, and this requiring interventions to ensure continuity of existing nutrition services and increased coverage of services for treatment of acute malnutrition (SAM and MAM) among children aged 6-59 months in addition to increase the delivery of life-saving nutrition services in high needs locations.
The project will scale up the existing nutrition services for CU5 and PLW to fill the gaps (according to Nutrition cluster plan) in the high severity communities and IDPs hosting areas in Dana subdistrict, which are being provided with nutrition services including our OTP center, Stabilization center and 6 RRTs, the nutrition activities in this project will be implemented by 1 stabilization center located in Sarmada children&#x2019;s hospital which considered as a key referral pediatric hospital for health and nutrition cases in Dana subdistrict, and 6 extra rapid response teams (RRTs) will cover the community of Sarmada and more than 50 IDPs camps (Main locations: Burdaqly camps, Bab El Hawa camps, Wadi Abaas camps, Tal Elkarameh camps, Babisqa camps amp Burj Elnumra camps) through:
A. 6 RRTs cover the gaps in the communities of Sarmada, Bab El Hawa, Burdaqly and Burj Elnumra, each team will be consisted of 1 nutritionist, 2 CHW, 1 nurse and 1 data entry, these teams will work on:
- Screening and referral of children under 5 (CU5) and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) with dangers signs and medical problems to the OTP and SC centers.
- Providing emergency infant and young child feeding (IYCF-E) counseling and disseminating messages on IYCF-E recommended feeding practices.
- Distributing micronutrients for preventing of anaemia and malnutrition among children and pregnant, lactating women for the far communities and non able to be referred cases.
- Registering all screened cases and reporting to the nutritionists and data entry team members.
- Nutrition Supplements distribution.
- Disseminating messages (IEC/BCC) on IYCF-E recommended feeding practices amp rising awareness about COVID-19 pandemic.
- Identifying the abused cases among boys and girls 6-59 months, pregnant and lactating women to be referred to child protection partners to take an action.

B. Stabilization center in Sarmada children&apos;s hospital: Scale up the center with 10 extra beds with one more resident pediatrician and 3 nurses to cover the expansion of the center to have 20 beds in total, the center has now 10 beds and runs by 1 pediatrician, 1 Nutritionist, 3 nurses (1 nurse every 8 hours, 3 shifts) and 1 data Entry , 3 cleaners, covers inpatient services on daily 24/7, providing daily assessment and management of inpatient pediatrics for SAM with complications.
The staff of the center and the RRTs is qualified and trained in many topics in nutrition cluster.

So the project will contribute in covering the urgent gaps through scaling up the nutrition services in Dana sub-district and will play a role in facing chronic Malnutrition (Stunting) at the long term beyond the project end.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Risk Education, ERW Contamination Impact Survey and VA Referral Case Management in NW Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is consistent with HALO&#x2019;s contribution to the 2020 HRP (ref: HSYR20-PRO-MIN-164140-1). It reflects lessons learned from HALO&#x2019;s experience in NW Syria since 2016 amp consultation with the Mine Action Sub-Cluster (MASC), CCCM, Health amp Education clusters amp OCHA&#x2019;s Access Working Group.

HALO will deliver a 12-month response, through direct implementation amp support from an implementing partner (iMFAD). The project includes Risk Education (RE), Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) Enhanced Contamination Impact Survey (ECIS), Victim Data Collection (VDC) amp Victim Assistance (VA) referral case management in selected districts across opposition-controlled areas of Idleb/western Aleppo amp Turkish-controlled areas of Aleppo. HALO will cover opposition-controlled areas, iMFAD will cover Turkish-controlled areas. The response is identical in both areas. Field staff will also be trained to deliver community COVID-19 awareness messaging consistent with WHO guidance. The project concept of operations is at Annex A (slide 8).

HALO will strengthen its presence in Gaziantep, reducing its presence in Amman. Project staff is 52 &#x2013; 19 funded at 100% (HALO: 7, iMFAD: 6, contracted drivers: 6) - all in Syria amp 33 funded under shared arrangements (HALO: 23, iMFAD: 10). 32 of 52 staff are in NW Syria. The project organogram is at Annex B.

According to the 2020 HNO, ERW contamination increased by 29% from 2018 to 2019, with communities most at risk located near the frontlines of conflict and in urban centres. HALO&#x2019;s extensive amp ongoing ECIS work in NW Syria confirms the ongoing threat posed by ERW. With official ERW disposal yet to commence in NW Syria, RE continues to plays a critical role in improving awareness amp reinforcing safe behavior amongst children amp adults.

2 x 5-person Community Liaison Teams (CLTs) (1 x HALO, 1 x iMFAD) will deliver standardized 30-40 min community-based RE sessions to children and adults, with content consistent with MASC key messaging. The priority will be IDPs in preparation for return to contaminated home communities. CLTs will also deliver training to Community Focal Points (CFPs) amp NGO Focal Points across all humanitarian sectors to improve the integration and reach of RE messaging. The total target is 19,760 beneficiaries (9,690 children, 9,690 adults amp 380 CFPs/NGO Focal Points). Beneficiary calculations are at Annex C.

CLTs will also provide ECIS support upon request (from other humanitarian actors amp local authorities) to identify, mark, report amp map ERW contamination in targeted districts. This activity is a continuation of HALO&#x2019;s ERW survey work in NW Syria, which is scheduled to be completed by 31 Aug 2020. 

Additionally, 3 x VA Case Management staff (2 x HALO, 1 x iMFAD), with support from CLTs, will collect amp analyse victim/survivor data from ERW amp other conflict-related accidents in order to identify referral requirements to specialised services. Case Management staff will ensure effective referral to relevant support services (as available), including transportation, amp maintain a relationship with referred beneficiaries throughout the process. This activity will enhance the resilience of people living with injuries amp disabilities (PLWD) and will complement other HALO projects with VA components (e.g. physiotherapy, prosthetics, psychosocial support, multi-purpose assistance). These efforts improve successful referral rates for survivors needing assistance, which indirectly relieves pressure on the Health cluster amp other clusters. The target is 285 interviews with a 50% successful referral rate for victims/survivors requiring assistance.

The project will be led by the combined HALO/iMFAD project office in Gaziantep, supported directly by HALO staff in Amman amp iMFAD staff in Balikesir. All field activities will be coordinated from HALO&apos;s Operation room in Amman.

The project has a Plan B, in order to mitigate key risks including access problems, security amp COVID.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integration of protection services into health facilities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SAMS through this Project will scale up its integration of protection services (GP, GBV, and MA) into health facilities utilizing SAMS experience and success stories in the field of intervention in addition to the lessons learned collected throughout similar projects.

The planned PSS and GBV services will be integrated into 7 health facilities in Idleb and Aleppo governorates (Idleb Central Hospital, Alsahara PHC, Al-Ebzemo PHC, Alatareb Hospital, Batbu PHC, Aldana Hospital, and Sejjo Hospital) where a safe space (protection space) in each facility will be dedicated for those services. Each protection space will have 2 PSS workers + 1 GBV case Manager + 1 Case Worker, they will provide in center and outreach (GBV and GP) services including: Identification of cases GBV case management GBV prevention and awareness raising non GBV and non CP case management PSS monthly Protection monitoring surveys and Referrals to specialized services (CMR, HLP, Health, mental health, livelihoods, etc.,) Key messaging and awareness raising targeting beneficiaries in direct contact with humanitarian workers on the PSEA and community awareness for all protection concerns. 

As for the MA component, it will be provided in two health facilities (Afrin (Alshifa&#x2019;a) hospital, where SAMS currently providing VA services and plans to sustain the services through this project, Sejjo hospital, where SAMS took over the facility from another NGO and plan to reactivate the physiotherapy services for the survivor from explosive hazard. The VA team in each facility will consist of: 4 Physiotherapists + 4 PT assistants + 2 PSS workers, they will provide specialized services (PT and rehabilitation in addition to MHPSS services) for the survivors of explosive hazard accidents (both in center and outreach mobile services), Moreover, SAMS will refer the survivor to livelihoods service providers.   

SAMS will follow all the precautionary measures as per SAMS COVID 19 PRP and in alignment with the COVID-19 Protection Cluster Recommendations and Observations on the Criticality of Protection Activities in NW Syria (March 2020) and Best experiences and practices in implementing GBV programs in the time of Covid-19. Furthermore, awareness against COVID 19 will be included in all community messages and awareness activities.

Finally, As an integral part of this approach, and in order to enhance the capacities and competencies of the PSS workers to improve the quality of the services provided through all protection cluster partners, SAMS is proposing a complementary activity that aims to assess the current capacity of the available PSS workers operating in NWS - including their educational background - where in coordination with the Protection cluster and Protection partners, SAMS to develop a PSWs capacity-building strategy for Northern Syria that will include the standards of the educational requirement for both PSWs and their trainers and the curriculum needed for qualifying those who work in the psychosocial support sector that will serve as a scientific method and technical reference that helps in providing a systematic service.

Protection services in SAMS intervention will be through MA (50%), GBV (25%), and GP (25%).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mitigating child protection risks for IDPs and the host community in northwestern Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to draft of HNO 2020 issued by OCHA ,5.7 million children are in need of protection, with key need drivers including: ongoing exposure to hostilities, specifically in north-west and north-east Syria limited access to services and displacement, frequently separating children from family members, including primary caregivers, and disrupting education. 2.45 million children aged 5&#x2013;17 are out of school, heightening their protection risks
were reported to have been recruited by parties to the conflict. Cases of torture, detention, abduction, sexual violence, denial of and lack of access to humanitarian assistance due to lack of civil documentation, among other factors, were reported
Incidents of girls and boys being married off at young ages and withdrawn from school in order to work, often in dangerous conditions, were also observed
The needs assessment which have done by AHF  indicate that there are vulnerability points with the children and primary care providers  associated with the direct risks of worst forms of child labor, disability, physical / psychological injuries, severe neglect, family separation (including expected separation due to COVID19), child recruitment and child marriage.
The project aims to reduce the protection risks for displaced children and the host community in northwestern Syria in line with the minimum standards for child protection by expanding the services provided at the AHF Center in Janoudiya by increasing the interventions of the following child protection activities:
1.	Raise awareness between the women, men and children about CP issues through mobile teams
2.	Implement case management services that address the children&apos;s vulnerabilities and primary care providers associated with the direct risks of the worst forms of child labor, disability, physical / psychological injuries, severe neglect, family separation (including expected separation due to COVID19), child recruitment and child marriage. These services will be provided by workers specialized in case management through the AHF Center
3.	Building the capacities of child protection workers in case management.
Child protection activities will be implemented in the Janoudiya area in Jisr Al-Shughour and the surround area, and the project will target host communities, IDPs and returnees, community centers and  camps. The center will be served the most vulnerable children. All activities are in line with the Humanitarian Response Plan 2020 in addition to the strategic objectives of the Protection Cluster and the SCHF allocation paper. The services will be provided for one year
The project will coordinate with the affected population and stakeholders and it had been designed to strengthen gender balance. 
The project aims to include children with special needs, and all activities will be carried out according to the recommendations of the protection cluster and WHO in order to deal with Covid-19 and the preventive measures required to protect beneficiaries and humanitarian workers.
The project will be monitored by the MampE team, in order to monitor the progress of the project and ensure activities are implementing according to the work plan and agreed indicators.
The project will ensure accountability of the affected population and stakeholders through transparency of accountability, the complaints mechanism, the feedback mechanism, and the monitoring of worker efficiency</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Continuation of the provision of Integrated Protection and Legal Services to IDPs and Host Community members through a community center in Afrin District, Aleppo Governorate, and Jisr Ash Shugur District, Idleb Governorate in Northwest Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to continue providing the integrated GBV and legal assistance services in the already existing two Community Centers that are funded by the UN/IOM and run by Hope Revival Organization (HRO) until the end of June 2020 in Darkoush community/Idleb, and Afrin community/Aleppo.  
SADA Organization (Prime applicant), in partnership with HRO (Sub-applicant), will share the responsibilities and follow a protection-centered and community-based approach to ensure that a greater number of Syrians have safe access to these services and their protection risks and vulnerability is further reduced. 
The community center aims to provide a space where men, women, boys, and girls can socialize and strengthen previously fractured social networks, gain access to specialized protection services including GBV case management, obtain specialized information/legal support on Civil Status Documentation (CSD)/Housing Land and Property (HLP), and receive information on services available in the wider area. 
SADAD will target men, women, girls, and boys including most vulnerable ones, inside and outside WGSS in CCs in the two locations with GBV awareness-raising sessions (entry point to identify protection cases, risks, and needs), life skills, vocational training, and free space activities including recreational and handcraft activities, to strengthen social inclusion and enhance prevention of negative social norms that underpin the normalization of GBV.
While HRO will provide GBV Case Management, GBV Young Mother Club services, in addition to capacity building for GBV project staff and for frontline humanitarian workers including health staff on GBV related issues to empower the community members and enable them effectively contribute to the prevention and response to GBV issues. Dissemination of key messages on COVID-19 will always be considered in project sessions. 
 To ensure the staff well-being and alleviate the stress, burnout, and anxiety produced by the outbreak of coronavirus. And as a specialized organization in MHPSS. HRO will support the project staff in Turkey and Syria with regular physical or remote self/staff-care sessions by specialized focal point.
The two centers are located in safe and accessible locations. Activities are designed based on identified needs considering culture, context, age of beneficiaries. 
Coordination at the field and central level will be closely followed by SADAD and HRO to ensure the effective engagement of community members in project activities and that the project is smoothly progressing.
Each partner will monitor and evaluate its activities by one MampE focal point who will coordinate with the MampE managers in Turkey, using MampE toolkits developed by GBV SC. Moreover, HRO will rely on Protection Cluster recommendations while monitoring the legal services and activities. The project manager/SADAD and project officer/HRO, in Turkey, will supervise and follow up on the day-to-day performance of field teams, work plans, safety and security measures and actions, HR, procurement, and finance-related tasks in coordination with the concern departments and with project field coordinators. SADAD and HRO program managers (in Turkey) will facilitate and lead the monthly review meetings to ensure that the project is on the right track in line with the overall objective, scope of work, timeline, and budget.

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Space of Peace (SOP) through this project aims at mitigating protection risks and responding to the critical protection needs in Ariha district, by providing life-saving and specialized Gender-Based Violence (GBV) services in Women and Girls Safe Space (WGSS) and child protection services in Child Safe Space (CFS). Through outreach teams in Ariha taking into consideration all the technical guidance notes of COVID 19, where the population of this area at high risk after their hard displacement experience recently. By the time they were able to return, COVID-19 pandemic emerged globally posing additional concern to them. This encouraged people to return to their demolished houses instead of facing the risk of infection in the camps.
SOP has a presence in Ariha through protection projects in the area for 4 years ago and managed to build trust with the community. The center became known to all the different age and gender groups in the community. Our past protection interventions had a positive impact on the community in general and especially on women, girls, boys including PWD. The exacerbated needs and the staggering protections risk in this district have been identified through rapid assessments and stressed by the local council in Ariha that welcomed our return to the area to provide our usual services. 
Through this project, SOP will work to achieve the following outcomes, through operating static centers and mobile teams:
1) The safety, dignity, and well-being of vulnerable women and girls are improved.
2) Address the specific protection needs of children who are survivors or at risk of violence, abuse, and exploitation through providing quality-specialized child protection services.
3)The resilience of the local community is enhanced by providing lifesaving emergency protection services and protection monitoring.
SOP will target in Ariha district 5 communities(Ariha, Motaram, Nahaleh, OrmEljoz, and Nahliya with a total population of 86843 people (17921 men, 20913 women, 28919 boys, 19090 girls). SOP will target 2737 women, 2865 girls, 1975 boys, and 713 men of returnees&#x2019; host communities and IDPs through this project with specialized and none specialized protection services three parts (GBV, CP, PM).
GBV activities: The activities will be provided along with a full package of other services mitigating GBV risks through like awareness-raising sessions including GBV, SEA risks, group and individual PSS sessions, case management, referral services to survivors of GBV and empowering women, girls through life skills and vocational training. Mobile teams will be covering Ariha communities and will be reaching out to cover the proposed areas. We will also provide responses to GBV risks through case management and referral to other services.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increasing self-resilience of the persons with functional difficulties by providing  prosthetics and creating inclusive protective environments through community and beneficiary participation</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will form a complementary part of HIHFAD on-going comprehensive supports to survivors of ERW and other conflict-related and nonrelated injuries  (mobile outreach service, fixed rehabilitation service, prosthetic service, inclusion mainstreaming and peers counselling) with multiple partners. In addition, the project emphasis on participation of the beneficiaries themselves and the community members to harness inclusive and protective environments in the target communities through establishment of community networks on inclusion and case management.

Building on HIHFAD&#x2019;s previous success in harnessing self-reliance and self-confidence among the most marginalized group, the proposed project aims at increasing self-resilience of the persons with disabilities and creating inclusive and protective environments through community and beneficiary participation. 
Through three inter-connected components
1) Benefiting and empowering people with amputations directly through prosthetic supports in Northwest Syria. 
2) Enhancing community-based inclusive approach and protection among the local communities and local NGOs through creating community inclusion networks.
3) Providing customized supports of their choices to the persons with functional disabilities through case managements 

1-Provison of 200 prosthesis in Albab city (8 months)
This project is a co-fund to operate Al Bab Center for additional 8 months between November 2020 and June 2021(the center is funded till Oct 2020 by HALO Trust)During 8 months, the center will install 200 prosthesis.
The beneficiaries will be selected from HIHFAD beneficiary list or through referral channels, after determining their ability to receive a prosthetic limb based on their K-level(a rating system used to indicate a person&apos;s rehabilitation potential).
The selected beneficiaries will undertake required physical rehabilitation at the HIHFAD rehabilitation centre prior to receiving prosthetics.
Transportation will be provided for the beneficiaries in need throughout the whole process.


2- Enhancing community-based inclusive approach (12 months)
The project will target 14 community, 1 inclusion network will be established in each community consisting of people with and without functional difficulties. They will first undertake inclusion training for themselves, and later, they will actively engage in planning and conducting of the following tasks:
- Plan and provide training and awareness sessions on inclusion of people with disabilities. 
- Identify and refer people with disabilities
- Become an agent of advocacy in their communities for rights of people with disabilities
-Plan and conduct community events of their choices.
In addition, the project will conduct evidence-collection activity to compile lessons learned from community-based inclusive approach.
3 - Case Management and Protection Assistance: 
300 beneficiaries and their families among the most vulnerable households will benefit through case management, offering PSS sessions, protection assistance, referrals, specialized service and access to socio-economic activities.
The beneficiaries can request their choices of supports, which will be assessed and verified by the committees (HIHFAD staff and community members). This could include items to immediately reduce constrains faced by the most vulnerable households or more resilience-focused choices such as skill training, livelihood kits accelerated education.  
An average value of 180USD per person will be allocated for multi-purpose assistance through case management.
The coronavirus pandemic expands an existing gap in the provision of this project services.This project was designed taking into consideration the expanded needs.
The mentioned activities will take place in Aleppo/Afrin/Afrin- Jandairis- Sharan, Aleppo / Alabab/Albab, Aleppo /Jabel Samman/Atareb, Idleb/Harim/Dana,Idleb- Maaret Tamsrin</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhance access to life-saving community-based protection services (GBV  MA) for IDPs and host communities in four locations in northwest Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WSA runs three WGSSs in Bennish, KafrTakarim, and Kaferlucin in Idleb, NW Syria, and plans to continue implementing activities through providing protection services for women and girls affected by the crisis, including GBV survivors and persons affected by war injuries and mild physical disabilities. These are backed by Casualty Data Collection that is going to be shared with IMSMA and to help in identifying cases and needs for planning. Besides the three mentioned locations, our partner NAS will conduct RE and VDC services in Idlib sub-district. COVID-19 awareness messages -and prevention procedures- will be put into consideration in all activities.
The WGSS in Bennish, provides protection services for WampG, in line with the UNFPA Guidelines, including WampG with a mild physical disability. The center contributes to the promotion of services and measures of MA and quality GBV services providing appropriate services to prevent and reduce the risks of GBV, ERW, and COVID-19 in the mentioned location. The center offers child care to improve access for women with little children, besides an outreach service through trained mobile teams that can reach beneficiaries who cannot come, or have no access, to the center. According to the latest developments regarding the global pandemic of Coronavirus, the WHO guidelines, and following the guidance note on the provision of GBV and MA services during the COVID-19  Pandemic, developed by the GBV and MA SCs WSA has begun to provide the services by reducing the number of beneficiaries inside the centers and increase the outreach activities, taking into account the recommended prevention measures.
In terms of the other two locations (in KafrTakarim and Kaferlucin), MA service will be provided, including RE and VDC, plus referring cases in need of individual assistance. These services are going to be provided through fixed and outreach activities.
Indoor activities:
Train teams on how to prevent COVID-19 and RE communicating messages to beneficiaries (IDPs, host community, and humanitarian actors), casualty surveys, GBV, and RE.
Provide specialized GBV services and CM, in addition to group and specialized individual PSS. 2 CM workers will follow up with the WampG-GBV survivors- including survivors of ERW accidents and affected by war injuries and mild physical disabilities. In addition to providing direct support service and referrals to other services according to the referral paths that are shared by the sub-clusters, and service mapping through coordination with actors in the area, continuously updated.
Provide vocational training (sewing) for the most vulnerable WampG.
Case management principles to be followed, privacy, informed, a survivor code. All case-related files are kept confidentially in a locked cabinet and are periodically destroyed after e-copies are held secured, where only the CW and the T-supervisor can reach them.
Preventive activities, such as life skills (My safety my wellbeing) and recreational activities, young mother&#x2019;s club in coordination with SRD and CARE.
Distribution of awareness GBV (GBV-SC package), RE (MASC messages), Covid19 (WHO tools) brochures.
Refer cases/victims in need of individual assistance (VA).
Outreach activities:
 Provide emergency response for WampG: PFA, CM and referral, registration for GBV cases, and VDC for ERW survivors.
Conduct awareness sessions for Covid19, using posters in the camps.
Training sessions for non-specialized service providers in the field of GBV, RE, and Covid19 prevention measures, with a focus on health staff, on best practices in dealing with GBV and ERW survivors.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing essential general protection and child protection services to conflict-affected girls, women, boys, and men in Idleb, Ariha and Jisr-Ash- Shugur</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Syria Relief SR aims to continue providing General Protection and Child Protection services in south and west Idleb, after starting delivering those services in north Idleb under the 1st RA 2020. The project aims to deliver planned services to most vulnerable Girls, Boys, Women and Men GBWM in Idleb, Ariha and Jisr-Ash- Shugur districts through 4 static community centres CCs within 4 relatively densely populated communities in addition to 4 mobile units.
SR will ensure the services are accessible by PwDs and will consider all possible precautious measures (social distancing and using the PPE) and Cluster guidelines related to adapting Protection services delivery modalities in light with COVID-19, to ensure the safety of staff and beneficiaries and avoid causing harm (see attached SR COVID-19 Response Plan).
The services will be delivered during 12 months starting from 1st of Jul-20, addressing the identified Protection and CP needs of targeted individuals.
 The Overall Project Objective is designed to provide integrated protection and CP services and coordinate closely with local service providers from other sectoral services (FSL amp Early Recovery, WASH, and Health-Nutrition actors) to facilitate access of persons with specific needs to those services. 
The outcome of the proposed intervention will be conflict-affected and most vulnerable GBWM, including PwD, have a better understanding of their rights and better resilience through benefitting from legal Protection, Protection and Child Protection services.
 This Outcome has been informed by the ASOs 1 and 2 as outlined in the 2020 1st Standard Allocation. 
SR aims at the continuation of protection activities within areas of operation. Besides, the protection teams will extend their reach into new subdistricts in Idleb governorate rated 4, 5 or 6/ 6 in the severity scale. 
Protection services are intended to provide a package of essential preventive and responsive services to affected Host communities, IDPs and Returnees through expanding the capacity of mobile outreach teams, reactivating Ariha centre (CFS), and launching new Protection activities in parallel with the existing Education activities that SR implements in Jisr-Ash- Shugur. 
 The project is designed to reactivate Ariha static facility that SR evacuated in Oct-20 and add 1facility in Korin, 1 in Jisr-Ash-Shugur and the fourth facility in Hanbushiyeh. The 4 static facilities will be community hubs through which SR can identify and respond to most affected populations. 4 mobile units will be attached to those centres to reach out PwDs or those practising voluntary quarantine so they cannot visit the centres. The gender-mixed mobile units will also deliver the project services within 8 neighbouring communities.
The proposed CCs and mobile units will provide many general protection and child protection services including awareness-raising about legal protection, general protection and CP concerns. SR Teams will also provide case management and IPA to the identified most vulnerable GWBM. PSS will be delivered to girls and boys. Besides, parents will have the opportunity to join positive parenting skills sessions. Training about HLP/CSD and CP will be delivered to concerned humanitarian workers to ensure they are well capacitated. Community-based Protection committees will be supported. Furthermore, the Protection Teams will be part of the current Cluster taskforces and collect data related to Protection Monitoring and Child Protection Situational Monitoring surveys. Emergency focal points will be assigned to contribute to Cluster efforts in coordinating the Protection response. 
Protection services will provide a secure and supportive environment, building on existing capacities within the local communities and expanding the population of SR response team. SR Protection Teams will implement all Project activities directly with support from SR Turkey Office.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Facilitating access to clean and safe drinking water to conflict-affected communities in Idleb 2020 - 2021</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GOAL proposes to support 16 Water Stations (WSs) managed by 3 Water Units (WUs) in Idleb Governorate to enhance their capacity to meet increased local water demand owing to population displacements, outlined in section 2 of this proposal. The aim of the action is to ensure access to reliable, safe and clean drinking water by conflict-affected communities including host and displaced populations in the northern sub-districts of Idleb Governorate. This will be done through infrastructure rehabilitation and repairs, training and coaching to WUs and subordinated WSs staff, and water quality management. Complementary to this, COVID-19 adapted hygiene promotion sessions and COVID-19 community led action (CLA) sessions will be carried out. The project is a continuation of the ongoing OCHA Syria Cross-border Humanitarian Fund (SCHF) funded project (TUR-19/3559/SA2/WASH/INGO/14498) that is currently due to end on 08 July, and is pending modification request approval for extension until 31 July 2020. 

The proposed action will enable approximately 180,369 people living in the targeted WSs&#x2019; catchment areas to regularly access adequate quantities of clean and safe drinking water, piped directly to households (HHs). Approximately 35 litres/person/day (LPD) will be pumped to HHs. This is in accordance with current WASH Cluster COVID-19 guidance. Additionally, 3,150 people attending GOAL distributions under other projects will be reached with COVID-19 adapted hygiene promotion sessions and 350 individuals will participate in COVID-19 CLA sessions through this action. In total 3,500 people will benefit from hygiene activities.

GOAL&#x2019;s wider WASH programme, including the current active version of the proposed project, has undergone an intensive COVID-19 preparation and adaption process that will enable GOAL to continue providing these essential WASH services in the case of a COVID-19 outbreak.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is designed to support the most vulnerable IDPs with WASH services and winterization NFIs in Idleb camps by providing clean water, water tanks, hygiene kits, hygiene awareness, garbage containers and latrines as well as supporting the same targeted camps with heating fuel through restricted value E-vouchers.
Total beneficiaries is1622 HHs, 9622 individualls(2310 W, 2211 M, 2215 G, 2886 B) as following Camps:
Maaret Tmasreen (AlHamra:291,AlFesal,Al-Ajaj 214)
Dana (AlMadina 500,Huzefa bin Al-Yaman153,Brdghli 100)
Harim (AlMatar Road 80)
Salqeen (AlRefatyah100)
As targeted camps are already supported by Takaful till July, so, the continues of providing services is critical in saving individuals lives, un addition to benefiting from pre-provided supplies. 
The project will achieve its objectives through a combination of two main interventions:
WASH:
-In the first 3 months We will construct collection tanks in the camps and connect it with water sources by establishment a water supply network from the available sources to the high-water tanks in addition to linking it to the sub-tanks via a network within the camp ground for the following camps (bin Al-Yaman, Brdghli.Al-Matar, AlRefatyah) in order to increase sustainability and enviromental preservation, and during this period, we will provide water trucking 40 liter per person per day.
In (Al-Madina, Al-Hamra, Al-Fesal and Al-Ajaj) camps we will provide water trucking due to the inability to connect these camps to water sources for several reasons such as the large distances between camp and the source, necessity of the network passing through private lands or the camp location in high mountainous.
-To enhance the ability of the beneficiaries to hygiene, especially with condition of COVID19, we will distribute two hygiene kits for each family in the 2nd month and in 4th month and the contents will be according to cluster guidelines. Also, hygiene promotion sessions will be conducted in targeted camps, through trained mobile team (M,F) about the hygiene, COVID-19 preventions and IEC , taking into account the prevention procedures, social distancing and sterilization.
-Then we will work on construction of 244 latrines (122 blocks) according to cluster standards related to COVID-19, gender sensitive by building separated blocks, safe accessible, and its doors provided with locks, latrine for PwD with special arrangements, septic tanks will be desludging every 20 days.
During implementation of the project 203 garbage containers will be installed for the waste disposal once each two days for each camp will be implemented.

NFI:
At the beginning of winter, the same beneficiaries will be provided with restricted value E-voucher with total value of $180 which was determined to meet HH&apos;s winterization needs of 360 liter of fuel and a stove &quot;based on SNFI cluster guidance&quot; by dividing this value into three phases, where a specific balance ($60-$60-$60) will be loaded to HH&apos;s voucher at the beginning of each phase. 
1622 HHs will be targeted with various fuel types (Kerosene-Diesel&#x2013; Firewood and Olive pits) and stoves where this diversity will give the opportunities for HH to choose the type of fuel prefer and the related stove from the vendors who prefer, vendors will be selected according to specific criteria.
we will conduct a PDM to ensure that the service arrived to the beneficiaries in a smoothly and to measure beneficiaries satisfactory
In case of displacement during the implementation, priority will be given to newly IDPs, furthermore, if an urgent problem occurs and there is no possibility to distribute in one of targeted location, we will replace the beneficiaries and choose another beneficiary according to criteria in another location in coordination with SNFI Cluster
-Principles of Do No Harm will be applied in all activities through several market visits, distribution monitoring
We will coordinate with NGOs and the clusters to avoid any overlap.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support the people in the north of Syria by providing WASH services</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is designed to respond to the WASH needs of 166592 people (Men: 27765, Women: 28321, Girls: 54975, Boys: 55531),(140876 IDPs and 25716 hosted people) with 1421 people  of them are people with disabilities, to respond to their protracted needs  by ensuring the good access to the  sanitation service 
The men, women, boys, and girls in Dana city are suffering from the poor sanitation infrastructure in the city since the sewage network is covering only 50 &#x2013; 60 % of the city and it was prepared to serve this small city with a maximum capacity of 16751 people while the  city and due to the ongoing crisis witnessed large displacement waves and the number of IDPs touched more than 140,000 IDPs which consist more than 85 % of the population of Dana 
These terrible figures increased the suffering of the people and the pressure on the already weak  infrastructure and made from Dana city one of the most affected areas of Leishmania in northern Syria according to the information of the EWARN and the statement of the medical centers in the area in addition to the notable flood of the wastewater in the public street in all the seasons and especially in the winter which is damaging any humanitarian efforts to respond to the Leishmania cases since the main cause of the problem will remain, and the treatment solutions are useless as long
The spreading of Leishmania  is not caused by the poor sewage infrastructure only but also it is by the inability of the local council to put well solid waste management in place and this is another factor can increase the threat on the vulnerable people 
SECD is aiming to solve this long-known problem in the city by undertaking the rehabilitation of the sewage network in the city and supporting the local council to activate good solid waste management which is protecting the people from the expected flood in winter, reducing and eliminating the Leishmania causes and protecting the groundwater from the pollution which considered the main resource of the drinkable water in the city 
During the project SECD will conduct the following activities:
1-Rehabilitation of the sewer system which includes but not limited to Rehabilitation and extending of Sewer system network (HDPE 30cm diameter ):1770m, - (HDPE 40cm diameter ):1330m,- (HDPE100 cm diameter ):4393m, and Conducting about 70 manholes. 
3- undertake Fast and light rehabilitation of the solid waste landfill.
4-Rehabilitation and or /providing of the solid waste truck.
5-Support SWM unit with salaries and fuel for 5 months, and Uniform for the workers, masks, gloves to protect the workers of coronavirus-2019 with ensuring the application of cost recovery system for this activity in the future to achieve the sustainability in this service with Conducting solid waste campaigns to encourage people to participate in this humanitarian effort 
7-Conducting hygiene promotion campaigns.
8-Distribution of 3000 hygiene kits (two rounds) for new IDPs  which did not receive hygiene kits during the last three months .

SECD will be in close position with the local council,  the beneficiaries, the IDPs and the host community and will involve them in all the project stages from the planning till the closure of the project to adhere to the community engagement approach by inviting them to regular FGDs and open all the channels to receive their feedback, complaints, and opinions.
the proposed project ensure that the sanitation service would be provided to 7 schools, 4 hospitals, 2 children friendly center,2 Women empowerment centers, and 7 public bakeries.
Moreover, 264792 people (188084 IDPs, 76708 Hosted people ) living in (Termanin, Tal Elkaramej, Burdaqly, Sarmada, Hezreh - Hezri, Tilaada, and Dier Hassan) could be considered as indirect beneficiaries since they will benefit from the project because the main outlet sewer of these communities discharged to the main sewer of Dana city which SECD will rehabilitate and replace it</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of sustainable access to clean and safe drinking water for IDPs in Atma camps</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project activities aim to provide life-saving assistance that assures sustainable and safe access of 91,616 IDPs (17,256 Men, 20,464 Women, 28,998 Boys, 24,898 Girls 13742 PwD) living in Atma camps and informal settlements to clean and safe drinking water services through connecting IDP sites to a new installed drinking water system.


Need
------
Currently, drinking water is being supplied to IDPs living in Atma cluster through water tanks distributed withing the camps with limited storage capacity of the HHs living in the camp and informal settlements. The tanks are being filled by water trucking vehicles that transport the water from the nearby boreholes to the tanks. IDPs take their daily share of water from the water manholes next to the tanks and store it in jerrycans or containers. IDPs, especially the most vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly and PwD, face many risks and difficulties while obtaining water. One of the most critical risk is spreading infection with an infectious disease due to crowding at water distribution points, especially with the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition to health risks, there are protection risks that are increased with using water trucking method, especially for women, girls, PwD and children. These developments and causes have created an urgent need to upgrade the water system in IDP sites to provide sustainable solutions that ensure the effective and safe access of IDPs to safe and clean drinking water services.

Intervention
---------------
At the beginning of the project, Bonyan Organization will ensure the community engagement through discussion with main stakeholders -including all types of beneficiaries, key informants, and local authorities- to identify locations of water distribution points with considering the initial drawings of the water network. Then Bonyan will develop and sign MoUs with main stakeholders, including 1) Local Authorities, and 2) Humanitarian actors who work in water trucking services in the targeted camps (mainly Global Communities Organization.
Based on results of community engagement discussions, technical assessment, and topographic survey, Bonyan will develop detailed technical specifications and scope of work to identify the number of water distribution points and their distancing in every sub-pipe. The distribution points will feed safe drinking water pipes that will be connected to all tents/buildings in the targeted locations. Bonyan will carry out installation works, using a contractual method under supervision of Bonyan engineering unit, as listed here:
1) Pumping Station
- A ground water tank, capacity of 300 cubic meter
- 4 centrifugal water pumps, power of 15 HP per each
- Electric generator, power of 75 KVA
- Electrical control panel
- Key facilities of the station
2) Water Network
- Water network (HDPE pipes and shutoff valves)
- Connecting the network to existing nearby boreholes.

Besides that, Bonyan will establish 2 hygiene and awareness promotion teams to conduct and design proper awareness promotion activities that ensure physical distancing, COVID-19 related recommendations, and importance of saving water &#x2026; etc.

At the end, Bonyan will hand over the project to the community that is representative by engineering office of Local Authorities in Atma Cluster, and provide it with engineering layouts/ drawings, technical specification documents, and maintenance/ expansion instructions of the pumping station and water network.

Bonyan will achieve the project objective through a series of specific activities and processes, taking into account accountability to affected-people, protection mainstreaming and GBV/PSEA, risk analysis and mitigation, tight monitoring and evaluation processes, and effective coordination with all stakeholders, as well as, a coherent exit strategy that contributes to sustainable results of the project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Delivery of Essential Life-Saving and Life-Sustaining WASH Services in Areas of Return</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed action will provide life-saving and life-sustaining Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) assistance in Ariha and Atareb sub-districts. Targeted sub-districts are home to approximately half of all conflict affected people who returned during early April and are ranked as highest in terms of WASH severity of need by the 2020 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO). Planned activities have been developed in close coordination with the WASH cluster and other members with COVID-19 prevention measures incorporated across the program design.

The project will benefit a total of 58,450 conflict-affected people, of which 10,450 are Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and 43,500 are host community members in Ariha City and Jeineh Town (Atareb sub-district). All 47,500 beneficiaries targeted in Ariha are recent returnees, with approx. 3,000 of the 10,500 beneficiaries targeted in Jeineh also recently returned following conflict-related displacement 

The action will address critical gaps in access to safe water through rehabilitation works to Jeineh station and essential repairs to Ariha City water stations and existing boreholes completed during the first three months of the action. Provision of operational and maintenance support to water stations will be initiated from July in Ariha and from October in Jeineh (following completion of station rehabilitation works).  Field visits by Big Heart WASH Engineers and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) completed during May have shown that just under half of the Ariha City water network infrastructure was damaged by conflict escalations earlier this year, with replacement pipes required for approximately 15% of the Jeineh network. In response, targeted works to repair sections of the water networks will be completed in both communities during the first three months of the action. Priority will be placed on ensuring schools, health centers and reception centers have adequate access to water during the planning and implementation of water network infrastructure works. This will include the COVID-19 Quarantine Center planned by Violet in Ariha City and the medical points managed by UOSSM and Al AmeenThe creation of tariff systems will be initiated during November with levels of Operation amp Maintenance (OampM) support gradually phased out from February to ensure sustainability and maintain access to affordable safe water beyond the project duration (please see activity 1.1.5 for more detail). 

Sanitation services have been assessed and highly targeted upgrades to rainwater drainage systems will be completed in both communities from September through to November 2020. 

No selection criteria will be applied to planned water and sewage / rainwater drainage activities which will be delivered at community level to ensure all returnees, host and IDPs in targeted areas benefit from increased access to improved WASH services. 

In addition to ensuring access to adequate water and improved rainwater drainage, hygiene promotion and awareness activities will increase understanding of COVID-19 prevention and response measures and promote positive hygiene practices, safe waste management and ways to mitigate risks of waterborne and other diseases (such as Leishmaniosis). These activities will be conducted during the first four months of the action and supported by distribution of essential COVID-19 hygiene materials (soap and cloth detergents) to beneficiaries most vulnerable to the pandemic. 

The action is informed by technical assessments of targeted water and rainwater drainage systems completed by Big Heart Engineers and included under the Documents section of this submission. As such, proposed activities are evidence-based, technically sound and accurately budgeted.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">By the proposed intervention IYD aims to increase access to sustainable water services in three camps in Harbanoush, Maaret Tamsrin sub-district, the project will support the newly displaced IDPs from Maaret Alnuman to Harbansoh Camps with safe, clean and sustainable drinking water through rehabilitation works which they are proposed in this project including the expansion works for the existing water network to reach the camps around the village who are depending on the water trucking to ensure their daily water need, increase the pumping capacity in the village by equipping the drilled well by the local council with electrical and mechanical equipment such as generator, submersible pump and electrical control panel, also the works includes construction work for generator and pumping rooms in addition to high water tank with capacity of 60 m3 to ensure the proper pressure in the network to let the water reach all the targeted camp, and to ensure the sustainability of the system IYD will form water management committee from the camps residents, and train the committee to establish fees collection system, moreover, IYD will cover the daily need of water by provide the IDP&#x2019;s camp residents with daily safe and clean water through water trucking at least 35 liters per person per day of chlorinated water for drinking, cooking and domestic purposes for 3 months, during this period IYD will rehabilitate the water pumping system in the camp which will replace the water trucking method in the targeted camp, once the rehabilitation works completed, IYD will cover the operational cost for five months to the established water station which will support the water committee to register all HHs who will benefit from the services and built the tariff system. 

And to improve the hygienic conditions in the targeted camps, IYD will provide the IDPs site residents with solid waste collection and 200 locally made waste containers, IYD will address the gap in latrines numbers in the targeted camps by building 30 new latrines blocks (two cells), making them gender sensitive. and address the needs of elderly and disabled beneficiaries, also as complementary with the latrines IYD will provide desludging services and distribute hygiene kits to raise the hygiene awareness for the IDPs as well as prevention for COVID-19, The planned intervention will mainstream protection principles throughout the project cycle by considering the different needs of men, women, boys and girls. Construction of the latrines and the distribution of the water tanks will be consulted with women/men and boys/girls to ensure they serve the communities equitably and consider the specific needs of these groups. 

More specifically, the intervention will provide operational cost for two main water stations in Batbu and Kafr Deryan, the operational cost includes (fuel, spare parts, lubricants oil, and water stations and water networks operators&#x2019; salaries) for five months, by this activity IYD will ensure provide at least 40 liters per person a day for more than 65,000 individuals in both locations, and to ensure that all beneficiaries will have access to the water networks IYD will rehabilitate the existing water networks by replacing the damaged parts, installation for mechanical parts such as valves and expansion of new water line for the neighborhoods that not covered by the water network. The chlorination process will be under the full control from the IYD staff as well, daily samples from providing water and from the point of use will be taken to do the tests, and daily visit to the HHs to check the storage tanks and containers and ensure clean, this will be done through the water safety plan by IYD.

Finally, it is important to note that all the staff working on these interventions will be given the needed information of any other services in the area (protection, education, livelihood etc.). They will also be trained on safe identification and referrals.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rehabilitation of WASH infrastructure to ensure IDPs, returnees, and host communities have access to water and sanitation services in northwest Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To improve the living conditions of vulnerable conflict-affected households IDPs, returnees, and host communities, WATAN will implement integrated WASH assistance in western Aleppo governorates. This will ensure that basic needs are addressed at the household level, while also building the capacity of conflict-affected communities to cope with COVID-19. WATAN through this intervention will focus on the urgent needs of 47,833 individuals (11,152 men, 11,534 women, 12,243 boys, and 12,904 girls) (20,534 residents, 12,550 returnees, and 14,749 IDPs) residing in 4 communities (Abin Samaan, Babka, Daret Azza and Kafr Naseh in western Aleppo governorate). The planned intervention will include the following:
Water (Abin Samaan, Babka, and Kafr Naseh):
This project will cover the rehabilitation of 3 water systems to ensure 20,557 individuals (4793 men, 4957 women, 5263 boys, and 5544 girls) are receiving enough and safe water with at least 45 L /capita/day. Following the rehabilitation, WATAN under this grant will support the operation and maintenance (OampM) cost for 5 months with descending coverage as follow (100% for the first month, then 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% by the fifth month)
This methodology will give the space of the newly established cost recovery to contribute to the OampM under the supervision of WATAN field staff. Thus, confirming the functionality of the cost recovery system and ensuring a smooth exit strategy.
Trough the operation and maintenance support, WATAN will pay special attention to the water quality. WATAN will monitor the water quality in two main points, the water source, and the end-use.
As the project targets mainly 4 communities (Abin Samaan, Babka, Kafr Naseh, and Daret Azza), Daret Azza was not supported with water activities since after the coordination with the WASH cluster, it was noticed that SECD is covering the water part in the community. Thus, the intervention in Daret Azza is complimentary with SECD intervention in the area.
Sanitation, sewer network rehabilitation (Daret Azza, Abin Samaan, and Babka):
The project will cover the rehabilitation of three sewer networks in Daret Azza, Abin Samaan, and Babka to ensure 42,831 individuals (9,986 men, 10,328 women, 10,962 boys, and 11,555 girls) have safe access to sanitation infrastructure.
As ACU reported, the number of water-borne disease (WBD)  cases have sharply increased by 1,278 cases in Atareb sub-district (ACU report 18/04/2020 to 09/05/2020), and by 945 cases in Daret Azza (ACU report 18/04/2020 to 09/05/2020). In addition and as ACU reported, Atareb sub-district has faced an incremental increase in the number of leishmaniases cases by 253 cases and by 39 cases in Daret Azza. This intervention will contribute to decreasing the number of WBD as well as the number of leishmaniasis cases in the area of implementation through ensuring safe disposal of the sludge with no drinking water contamination as a result of and not limited to broken and not functioning sewer system.  
Moreover, Kafr Naseh was not supported by the rehabilitation of the sewer system as this activity was conducted earlier by IYD. Thus, the activities in Kafr Naseh are complimentary as a result of coordination with the WASH cluster and IYD on the field.
Hygiene and COVID-19 response (Kafr Naseh, and Babka):
This intervention will pay special attention to the concerns related to COVID-19 outbreak, the response will include the distribution of essential hygiene items (Soap and washing powder) to support 8,074 individuals (1,883 men, 1,947 women, 2,068 boys, and 2,176 girls) for two rounds to tackle hygiene issues and thus contribute hopefully to eliminate the possibility of the outbreak in Jabal Samaan district in Aleppo governorate. Moreover, this project will provision of hygiene promotion sessions which will include messages related to COVID-19 prevention and will be lead by female hygiene promoters where possible and under the supervision of the protection specialist</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustainable water and sanitation infrastructure to support IDPs, host community, and returnees in Aleppo and Idleb governorates.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To improve the living conditions of vulnerable conflict-affected households and emphasize on the prevention measure to COVID 19, Saed Charity in partnership with Minber Alsham are planning to respond to 46,187 (out of which 16,426 Men, 17,519 Female, 6,046 Boys, 6,196 girls, and 412 PwD) IDPs in 20 camps and Kaften community to ensure an improved, sustainable access to WASH services and supplies.
In parallel to the WASH cluster strategy in the allocation paper, the aim is to reduce the huge reliance on the costly non-sustainable direct provision water trucking, desludging, etc. towards a more cost-effective cheaper and more efficient response, this is planned to be achieved through connecting the targeted camps and informal settlement to existing nearby water and sanitation system. Furthermore, through this project, SAED and Minber Alsham are aiming to ensure improved access of host communities and IDPs in Kaften community through rehabilitation and operational support for the water system.
The water system will be operationalized and maintained by both SAED and Minber Alsham for a period of 10 months for camps and five for Kaften.
As the number of IDPs and locations planned are high, SAED and Minber Alsham decided to partner together to ensure a better quality response, output and outcome, relying on the very good WASH knowledge and experience of both agencies taking into account that both SAED and Minber AlSham implemented a successful project together and managed to benefit from previous lessons learnt. 
During the design phase of the project, both SAED and Minber AlSham kept in mind any future influx of IDPs into the proposed locations, in a summary, we will be able to respond to any increase in numbers. If any gaps arise, SAED will officially inform the WASH cluster to assist and coordinate with other actors in the field to fill the gaps.
On average 30-35 ltp/d/ will be provided while during Summer season (July, August, and September) as recommended by the WASH Cluster, IDPs will have access up to 40 lt/p/d.

SAED will target 9 camps with a total population of 17,590 IDPs. While Minber AlSham will target 11 camps with a total population of 24,022 through the following activities:
	Rehabilitation and operational cost of four water systems
	Installing and extending water and sanitation network to the camps.
	Constructing high elevated tanks and rely on gravity distribution to the water points inside camps.
	Connecting existing sanitation facilities to installed water networks.
	Hygiene promotion campaigns (following COVID 19 WASH and health clusters recommendation including physical distancing through a mass media campaigns, street panels, WhatsApp sharing methods, etc. will be installed and shared in the premises of the camps as well as the community.
	Distribution of soap and cloth detergents

15 camps out of the 20 targeted already include an agency who are providing some activities. Therefore, this project proposal does not include a comprehensive package as some activities are covered by other agencies. All activities have been coordinated with present agencies to ensure complementarity and avoid overlaps.

In addition, Minber AlSham will target Kaften community (4,575 people) with rehabilitation and maintenance of the water station and water network in addition to degraded operational cost for 5 months in order to implement a proper cost recovery and tariff system. (Minber AlSham will work closely with the local council and beneficiaries to include them in the design and planning phase of set up. In addition, proper capacity building will take place for stakeholders involved in the tariff system to ensure better managing of resources and water system.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the Syrian conflict entering its 10th year, the humanitarian situation in northwestern Syria continues to deteriorate, impacting all life aspects of the Syrian families. The outbreak of the Coronavirus epidemic have added yet another dimension to the crisis and increased the burden on the vulnerable families while they strive to acquire their most basic needs. The negative impact of the pandemic is amplified in areas of large gatherings such as camps, informal settlements, and schools where the ability to apply social distancing rules is severely limited and high level of vulnerability prevents households from investing in precautionary measures such as increasing the use of hygiene items/facilities and Personal Protection Equipment (PPE).

Therefore, PIN plans through the proposed project to cover up to 10 camps with a package of assistance that is aimed at responding to the education needs of said camps in a qualitative and safe manner. In brief, PIN proposes the provision of a blended online and physical education to 2,600 school-aged children in 10 IDP camps, to adequately respond to the COVID-19 created needs with a tailor-made approach. PIN will take on providing students and teachers with the essential teaching and learning materials as well as recreational materials. PIN will cover the learning centers operational costs, including COVID-19 prevention materials, and fuel for heating during the winter months in order to keep learning centers well-functioning and to create a safe and child-friendly environment. PSS will be a fundamental part of the project aiming to improve the well-being and learning capacity of children and teachers, who are not only traumatized by the war, but experiencing many new stress factors and serious impact of the virus. All these services will be provided through the blended approach that combines cautious physical attendance with the distance learning module that PIN has already established across its education portfolio, and allows a prompt shift between the methodologies when needed, adapting to the context.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The deteriorating situation in NW Syria is weaking the community ability to seriously consider the prevention measures against COVID-19 pandemic. Also, recent reports showed increasing numbers in infections among population while the estimated number of people at high COVID risk is 2.9 million. the project is focusing on maintaining and enhancing children access to education as a response to COVID-19 pandemic and prevent children dropping out schools due to uncertain circumstances of the education through (i) implement safe school protocols (COVID-19 prevention and control) and (ii) adapt the distance learning modality benefiting 20,000 school aged children (7-18 years old- Boys 9,528 Girls 10,472 ~ 1,000 CwD) and 1,600 teachers and caregivers (Men 788 , Women 812) in 20 schools and 77 TLSs in Harim and Idleb districts (Idleb governorate) 

The project will increase the capacity of education services to provide COVID-19 safe learning environment through implementing prevention protocols in 20 schools for 17,500 school aged children (7-18 years old, 8,278 Boys, 9,222 Girls, 1,000 CwD) and 600 teacher (288 Men, 312 Women) by providing the required resources such as cleaning and sterilizing material, PPEs for teachers, and Water for schools&#x2019; WC blocks for the second semester of the academic year 2020/2021. Along with improving the WC blocks conditions by rehabilitation / expansion of 12 schools&#x2019; WC blocks and establishing 18 new WC blocks for TLSs in 9 camps Since the proper and adequate WASH facilities and services are a key factor in maintaining appropriate IPC measures. The WCs block will be gender separated and will include dedicated units for CwDs

On the other hand the project will support the Teachers, Children, and Parents to adapt the distance learning modality benefiting 2,500 school aged children (7-18 years old, 1,250 Boys, 1,250 Girls, 100 CwD) and 1,600 adults (Teachers and Caregivers) (788 Men, 812 Women). The multilevel support will ensure achieving the designated outcomes of the distance learning. Starting with the teachers, the teachers will undergo an online training program to introduce them to the new teaching methods that is used in the distance learning and introduce them to the softwares that is used along with other subjects detailed in the relevant activity in the logical framework. 20 training groups will target 600 teachers (288 Men, 312 Women). 
Children from the targeted schools will be selected based on the needs and vulnerability criteria and based on the education modality in their schools (face-to-face or distance learning) if a school had many confirmed COVID-19 cases and turned the physical education modality to the distancing modality. The project will provide internet vouchers to the most vulnerable children to allow them to continue receiving their online classes. In order to ensure that the children are committed to attend their lessons online, dedicated education supervisors will be assigned to follow up and measure the education outcomes along with the teachers and schools&#x2019; administrations. For the caregiver the education supervisor will conduct a caregiver engagement program in order to support children education at home level through enabling the caregiver to follow up, encourage, and support their children and ensure that the caregivers understand the importance of education for their children.

Bonyan will achieve the project objective through a series of specific activities and processes, taking into account accountability to affected-people, protection mainstreaming and GBV/PSEA, risk analysis and mitigation, tight monitoring and evaluation processes, and effective coordination with all stakeholders, as well as, a coherent exit strategy that contributes to sustainable results of the project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting the underserved communities in rural Idleb by life-saving aids and COVID-19 preventive masks.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project endeavors to implement integrated activities between FSL and ERL clusters in the humanitarian field in western rural of Idleb province in Jisr-Ash-Shugur district in Janudiyeh sub-district which is considered as high-needs and underserved areas, for both host community and IDP. This intervention will support 340 IDP households in the camps with live-saving food baskets to enhance their food security which will strengthen their immunity during the outbreak of COVID-19 as well. Also, the project will contribute to develop the household&#x2019;s livelihood through establishing sewing workshop as CFW activity for 20 women from host community and IDPs to fabricate 149500 masks wherein wearing mask is an essential preventive measure to break the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic nowadays for specific where the daily statistics from NW Syria about the numbers of people contracted with COVID-19 do not bode well, as the numbers are increasing at an alarming rate that threatens the entire society, which already suffers from poverty and neglection.
The proposed location is ranked as high priority for both COVID-19 outbreak and food security coverage for PIN wherein the HNO severity in this location is 4 out of 5.
The project includes:
I-Distribution of food basket for 340 IDP-households in the camps for eight consecutive rounds where the food basket will cover 100% of the household needs for food in order to achieve their nutrition status and healthy conditions, especially for children, women, pregnant, elderly during winter season and the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. The food basket&#x2019;s weight is 78.3 kg and it will provide the households members with 2100 Kcal/person/day which is equal to 100% per day as per Sphere standards. The FSL cluster recommendation was taken into account in the food basket design and determined food basket distribution modality because the markets in this area consider non-functional. We added 4 boxes of soap to the food basket as a protective measure against COVID 19.
II-CFW activity for 20 women form the most vulnerable households from both host community and IDPs by daily 5 working hours and daily wage 5 $ according to the CWG, by establishing sewing workshop for fabricating 149500 fabric re-usable masks according to the Public advisory on the use of fabric facemasks in the context of COVID-19 with low cost , and distributing the produced masks (4 masks for each beneficiary), according to the COVID-19 task force recommendation to, camps and host community. There will be 2 sizes of the produced masks, one suitable for adults 18 and above and other suitable for children 2 to 18 years old.
This project will support 37375 beneficiaries affected by the Syrian crisis (8016 men, 8429 women, 10203 boys and 10727 girls divided as the following 11755 HCs, 25480 IDPs and 140 returnees) by promoting their accessibility to the humanitarian assistance significantly.
All the people in the target locations and markets will benefit directly/indirectly from the project where the purchasing of the needed materials of both activities will be form the local markets. 
The project is designed with consideration to the clusters and WHO recommendation on prevention and mitigation measures related to COVID-19 especially during the distribution of support. Also,protection cluster recommendations were taken into consideration, wherein all the population in the targeted locations will benefit from the awareness session of MASRRAT protection team in terms of GBV referral cases, early marriage and child labor risks awareness raising sessions. 
The target locations:
- Janudiyeh village 9055 HCs and 7167 IDPs

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated emergency livelihood and SNFI support to vulnerable populations affected by COVID-19 and harsh winter conditions in NWS</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the increasing rise of COVID-19 cases in Northwest Syria and the upcoming harsh winter season as well as persistent violence and a weak economic system, vulnerable people in Dana, Idleb and Atareb subdistricts face significant livelihood challenges and the inability to access critical shelter and non-food items. IDP, host community and returnee populations chronically lack the ability to access livelihood opportunities and the existing manufacturing industries remained strained as a result of the compounding factors. Meanwhile, portions of the population in Dana and Atareb do not have the capacity to work also do not have access to critical household items for the upcoming winter season. This integrated project aims to strengthen the livelihoods of vulnerable people in these sub-districts to produce fabric reusable masks while also supporting people who do not have the ability to work but require urgent SNFI goods for the upcoming winter season. 

With the chronic lack of livelihoods and potential impact of COVID-19 as described above, the project aims to: First, scale-up emergency livelihood support focused on mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on the already precarious, pre-existing socio-economic deficits in NWS by providing vocational training and Cash for Work opportunities to 900 individuals in reusable fabric mask production in Dana, Idleb and Atareb subdistricts, and Second, provide business support to 50 new businesses, inactive existing sewing business and women&#x2019;s groups through business/capital grants and workforce support for mask manufacturers to protect livelihood sources in Dana, Idleb and Atareb subdistricts. As a third and complementary aim in relation to emergency SNFI support, the project will target 2600 households in Atareb and Dana subdistricts that do not have the capacity to work and provide them with cash for winter to purchase SNFI materials to mitigate the impact of the harsh winter season. 

This action aims to not only strengthen livelihood opportunities and the local economy but also to produce and distribute 635,000  fabric reusable masks to 158,750  individuals who do not have access to masks. The full suite of activities aims to meet both the acute and long-term needs of the vulnerable communities by providing short-term work opportunities, strengthening businesses, providing cash for winter to purchase SNFI winterization materials to 2600 vulnerable households not capable of working, and distributing critical COVID-19 mitigation materials and sensitization messaging to 158,750 people. 

UNDP is the global lead agency in the area of Early Recovery and Livelihoods Restoration with extensive experience in ERL projects, including inside NWS. UNDP will work in partnership with IYD, a national NGO which has experience in both ERL and SNFI projects. On the whole, UNDP will be responsible for overall management of the project and its oversight against programmatic and fiduciary risks through efficient contractual arrangements and administrative support. This will ensure timely implementation of the project, the high quality of activities and the program deliverables. Moreover, UNDP&#x2019;s early recovery and livelihoods team will provide technical guidance and expertise to ensure the quality and appropriateness of livelihood activities, the sustainability of the business support which will improve the effectiveness of the project and better outcomes for beneficiaries. The added value of IYD is anchored to their experience in both ERL and emergency SNFI activities in Idleb and Aleppo governorates, including previous livelihood support and winterization SNFI projects. The complementary partnership between UNDP and IYD will ensure the success of the project and that the needs of beneficiaries are addressed.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project targets 7 camps in communities in Dana sub-districts in four communities, most of these camps were established after the last displacement waves between Jan and March 2020, 3 camps are registered in CCCM and the other 4 are not, so GAN will register them as soon as possible, 
The project target 1102 families with cash for food, the cash intervention is feasible in these camps as they all have access to different main markets in the targeted communities, four rounds of cash for food will be distributed in Jan, Feb Mar and Apr 2021, each round consists of 2 weeks for distribution and 2 weeks for validation and PDM, 50$ will be allocated for each family as recommended by cluster and CWG, GAN conducted a deep coordination with different partners working in the same area as detailed in the coordination section, although the data gained form the FSL cluster indicate to more than 90% respond in Dana but no partner plan to target the same vulnerable and underserved camps, the camps were targeted by GAN bread campaign in Aug and Sep 2020, according to the interviews and assessment, 99% said that the first priority is food, the proposed modality is a cash for food, as it is considered one of the most effective modality since the markets are available near camps,
GAN will also train 15 committees in 6 out of 7 targeted camps and equip them with the needed tools for fire extinguishing, FAKs, and other flood tools, and the rest camp will be targeted by point organization as we coordinate with them.
GAN developed a detailed awareness plan includes Key messages about COVID-19 for parents, children, coping with stress during COVID-19, dealing with children and adults, PESA, GBV, and PSS, the awareness will be conducted online through WhatsApp
Monthly market assessment in terms of availability of the items, prices, and accessibility will be conducted to ensure the local markets are functioning and all beneficiaries have good and equal accessibility to the different goods.
GAN will contract with a money transfer agent after assessing the markets and the vendors&apos; capacities in the local markets. where the identified vendors will be responsible for delivering the cash amount to the beneficiaries in the different locations and the payment for the agent will be conducted after finalizing the distribution of each few days which reduces the security risk in delivering the cash in such a complex context.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency food assistance for vulnerable populations in Dana subdistrict.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the increasing rise of COVID-19 cases in northwest Syria as well as persistent violence and a weak economic system. Vulnerable people in Dana subdistrict face significant food challenges and the inability to access critical fresh food items. IDP, host community and returnee populations chronically lack the ability to access food, and COVID-19 items. Inflation has taken a serious toll on the prices of basic goods. IYD, therefore, proposes this response. This project will involve the provision of food assistance to 2,000 HHs

IYD, throughout this proposed project, is looking forward to meeting the food needs where many vulnerable families are either receiving inadequate food assistance or not receiving at all thus, IYD will implement the following activities:
-Provide 1,000 HHs (2,250 males, 2,750 females, and 250 PWDs) living in Sarmada camps (Kamora Sarmada, Um Near, Bsakala, Salah Aldeen, and Dia&apos;a 9 Kafroma ) with cash for food of  $ 50 value on a monthly basis for 6 rounds to buy fresh food at the markets to prevent/reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure. This activity will complement IYD&#x2019;s ongoing project with WFP and will target the displaced people in Sarmada clusters who are not covered by WFP project. Building on IYD&apos;s current project with SCHF under number 15,000, this project will target the same locations and caseload to improve and sustain access to food for those most in need. In terms of market availability and accessibility, IYD has conducted a marketplace assessment to ensure that target populations are able to access the markets near them. Please see the attached marketplace assessments (vendors and buyers).
- Distribute 1,000 ready-to-eat food rations (out of the targeted camps mentioned above) to COVID patients, and people who have had contact with COVID patients and must apply home quarantine. Through this activity, IYD will secure sufficient food items and encourage people who may transmit the infection to apply home quarantine, and thereby, contributing to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in NWS.


Since the allocation paper encourages partners to prepare effective budgets, IYD decided to utilize its own resources to decrease the implementation cost, thus maximize the benefit earned per beneficiary.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the proposed project is to deliver immediate support to respond to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in A&apos;zaz.The activities will be complementary to an on-going Covid-19 related project in A&apos;zaz under German Federal Foreign Office (GFFO) funding and is based on OPS project HSYR20-FSCSHLWSH.-165380-1.The project intends to integrate livelihood,food security and wash using a cash based modality.In North-West Syria NWS), the price of basic foods remains extremely volatile and is subject to speculation.Disruptive events, specifically displacement and COVID-19 have harmful and immediate consequences on the households&#x2019; economy and may result in reduced consumption and exclusion, requiring the adoption of a framework of priorities and actions that are focused on livelihoods. Proposed intervention has 2components:(1)distribution of cash to internally displaced persons(IDPs) in camps to cover their urgent lifesaving needs 2)Cash for Work(CfW)activities to respond C19 pandemic with a prevention intervention where women are provided with necessary tools/resources to produce fabric masks which will be distributed in schools,camps,facilities.1st component of project aims at covering needs of IDPs in camps in areas of food security and hygiene (multi-sectoral) through cash distribution to support HHs especially in winter as there are less opportunities for livelihood sources due to lack of availability of daily worksamp C19&#x2019;s impact on market. Primary objective of the project is to ensure that displaced families are assisted and provided with means for a dignified life until they have access to durable solutions.Grant will be provided via a money transfer agent following procedures agreed in SoPsincludes C19 measurements.Value of cash transfers will be $90 per HH for 5months,amount of voucher will be same with current WHH project to avoid tension between organizationamptargeted people.As ongoing project already covered for 3months,suggested project will be covering rest of 5months to be compatible with FSL cluster recommendation.There will be verification process for BNFsactivity will take place in Sijjo Okul (125 HHs), Sijjo Shuhada(154 HHs) and Sijjo Sifira(61 HHs)camps(Total number is 340 HHs).The second component is the production of facemasks through CfW.The benefits of wearing facemasks by the public in general in order to reduce the virus spread in communities is clear especially in locations where high-density gatherings cannot easily be prevented due to living conditions, and which are considered as a high risk area for the rapid spread of infection. Due to the lack of availability of medical masks and the necessity of prioritizing them for healthcare workers, reusable fabric facemasks are recommended. The fabric facemask will have three layers: an inner layer made from a 600 thread per inch (600 TPI) white cotton, a middle layer made from a high-thread-per inch (gt80 TPI) blend of 65% cotton and 35% polyester, an outer layer made from a high-thread-per inch (gt80 TPI) colored polyester. 20 women will be selected to produce the face masks, based on willingness to participate in the activity, tailoring skills (knowledge of use of sewing machines). They will receive a training on how to produce/sew fabric masks. Subsequently, WHH will provide each woman with a sewing machine together with the required materials to be used also for the training duration. Women will be producing fabric masks and will package them according to the instructions given during the training. On a weekly basis, they will be asked to produce approximately 3,000 masks which will be collected by WHH field team and distributed in schools, camps and selected facilities. The quality of the masks produced will be checked by the mask production consultant. He/she will provide regular supervision for the production and will report any challenges to the WHH Project Team. Women will be provided 90USD/month for 8 months. 15 PWD will be supported unconditiona</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the Health and FSL multisector project, Violet aims to implement integrated activities that contribute to lifesaving and  NWS&#x2019;s COVID-19 response by 1) isolation of the suspected/tested positive cases, and 2) provision cooked meals in the existing CCTC in Ariha, but also by alleviating the negative socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 by 3) the provision of cash for food. The project is designed with the following activities:

Health: Violet strives to maintain the existing CCTC capacity in Ariha to isolate the COVID-19 cases to slow down the transmission of the virus. Ultimately, the activities aim to reduce the morbidity and mortality among the community members, as well as to protect the health system from a potential collapse that might be caused by the rapid spread of COVID-19. Therefore, Violet is requesting funds to support the CCTC in Ariha for 11 months as funding from previous sources ends by mid-January 2021. This component will be linked to the COVID-19 response activities to maximize the project impact such as the referral system, provision of PSS, and wellbeing activities to the BNFs in the CCTC, outreach, and hygiene promotion, disinfection of the public places, and masks production and distribution. Further, it&apos;s coordinated with Violet&apos;s other projects and acts complementary e.g. through referrals.

Food security: Violet seeks to a) provide cooked meals and fresh vegetables and fruits for the patients admitted in Ariha CCTC based on FSL recommendations of at least 2100 Kcal for a person/per day. Moreover, the cooked meals are designed to include nutritious vitamins through fresh vegetables, fruits, pickles, and fresh yogurt to support the quick recovery of isolated cases.

Food security b) Violet plans to respond with lifesaving activities by providing Cash for food (50 USD per HHs) for the most vulnerable and at-risk HHs for 8 rounds. this intervention will also contribute to the COVID-19 response by reducing the negative socio-economic impact due to the COVID-19 outbreak Moreover, the targeted BNFs will also receive soap kits (750 gram/ HH) to improve their access to Hygiene means according to WASH cluster recommendation. the Target locations are the camps surrounding the proposed CCTC, and other CCTC supported by Violet in Idleb to improve the beneficiaries&apos; food consumption of fresh food and vegetables in the COVID-19 pandemic. The cash distribution modality was selected to provide more flexibility for the BNFs to buy their needs, but also to and provide assistance in a dignified way. Prior to cash distribution, Violet will conduct rapid needs assessments to ensure the beneficiaries&#x2019; accessibility to functioning markets to avoid the potential harm of cash inputs. Moreover, the cash will be distributed in USD to improve the purchasing power of the targeted HHs without being affected by the devaluation of the local currency

The project was designed complementary between both sectors by the provision of cooked meals and fresh vegetables to the admitted patients in the CCTC in Ariha, which will contribute to improving their immunity and quick recovery. But also through cash for food for the most vulnerable groups inhabiting the camps in the CCTC areas to alleviate the negative socioeconomic impacts due to COVID-19 and also improve their nutrition status when at risk of contracting COVID-19. 

During all project phases, Violet will ensure the field teams apply COVID-19 preventive measures according to Violet&#x2019;s SOPs. This includes applying social distancing, regular sanitization of the CCTC, and wearing face masks. Moreover, Violet ensures the preventive measures during distribution by minimizing the number of cash beneficiaries in each distribution round, carry out the cash distribution in the well-ventilated areas, as well as supplying the distribution points with sufficient hand sanitizers and cleaning materials.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Continuous Support for COVID-19 Community Treatment Centers CCTCs (SDH Centers)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SDH&apos;s strategy is to reinforce the continued support of the CCTCs to ensure adequate intervention for providing health services for the new suspected/probable/confirmed cases.
Through this call opportunity, SDH is advocating to ensure the continuity of the ongoing intervention funded by SCHF in (CCTC_5 &quot;Al-Seeraj Center in Hazano&quot; amp CCTC_7 &quot;Al-Seeraj Center in Daret Azza&quot;) which is ended by 14/11/2020. in addition adding another center (CCTC_3 &quot; Al-Seeraj Center in Atareb&quot;) for supporting as high priority location. where the Covid-19 outbreak Disease, is still affecting all the world, including the NWS, there is a high need for humanitarian relief, considering the health system in NWS is still fragile with an urgent need for continuous support and increases the capacity of the response to contain the sharp increase of infected cases.
Currently, SHD&#x2019;s through SCHF support is running two CCTCs located in Hazano amp Daret Ezza communities. Each CCTC will be run by 8 health professional staff (out of 32) to provide medical assessment, monitoring, and supportive therapy for the confirmed COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms and without underlying chronic condition (lung, heart, renal failure, or an immunocompromising condition. The CCTC aims to reduce the burden of the caseload at the overwhelming hospital care services and provide immediate support for the suspected cases referred to the centers including testing and diagnosis while providing supportive therapy for confirmed COVID-19 patients. Moreover, CCTCs will offer separate accommodation and restrict the movement of the suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases and providing PSS services as well. The CCTCs will be led by the Health Program management as it&apos;s already a focal point for continuous coordination with HC amp COVID-19 TF, at field level by already trained amp working healthcare workers and IPC workers and other support staff.
These CCTCs are already equipped with all needed equipment to be fully functional, while SDH with this fund opportunity will support the running cost of 3 CCTCs for eight months as the second stage of the COVID-19 response plan which includes 5 fully functional CCTCs in 2021.
the modality intervention will depend on the developed COVID-19 Taskforce operational guideline with 50-bed capacity per-center and distributed as follows:
1. observation areas with a capacity of 10 beds defined for highly suspected cases/contact developed symptoms and undergoing laboratory confirmation testing.
2. Isolation and case management areas with a capacity of 40 beds, run by medical staff to provide medical supportive therapy for confirming COVID-19 infection.
this proposal aims to cover all the approximately 480,000 population of the Aleppo amp Idlib targeted areas, by improving access to community isolation services for the most vulnerable group as following: (1) children lt18, (2) the elderly, (3) women of reproductive age, (4) IDPs and host communities(5) and people with disabilities, Through our proposed intervention. the estimated direct beneficiaries are 2400 Ind, with the indirect effect of maintaining the health safety of the rest of the targeted populations. 
this intervention of the SDH organization is well designed to fill the gaps in the current healthcare services in the targeted areas, in coordination with local authorities and Idlib amp Aleppo health directorates.
the project has a great advantage as all mentioned CCTCs are already functional, the staff is trained on IPC matter and the supply chain for PPE amp IPC is set with no need for a preparation period for operational processes, contracting, coordination with other partners. as all of these steps have finalized with the full functionality of these CCTCs and with the possibility to extend our current agreement and contracts. Overall the SHD&#x2019;s through this fund will maintain the current operational cost HR, logistics,s and provision of complementary medicines, consumable medical, PPE/IPC supplies.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting three Community-based COVID19 isolation and treatment centre (CCTC)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the start of the COVID19 pandemic, there have been about 50 million confirmed cases worldwide and more than 1.2 million deaths. These numbers have started to surge in many countries of what is called as a second wave. Meanwhile in Syria, the first case of COVID19 in the northwest was reported in July and it had been increasing slightly before it started to surge in mid of September. 

The overall objective of this project is to reduce mortality and morbidity of the affected population, aiming to provide COVID19 primary healthcare service through supporting two existing community-based isolation centres in Maart Tamsrin (CCTC-21) and Salqin (CCTC_24) and establishing one centre in Al-Bab city with an approximate coverage population of 300,000-200,000 inhabitants in each location. 

The three community COVID19 centres (CCTCs) have the capacity to provide medical assessment, monitoring, and support therapy for the confirmed cases with mild symptoms. The CCTC aims to reduce the burden of the caseload at the overwhelmed hospital case and facilitate immediate COVID-19 testing through ACU partner meanwhile the CCTC will continue providing supportive therapy for suspected and confirmed cases admitted in Centre. In addition, these CCTCs play the intermediate role of  \ a stabilization moderate case without medical complication and facilitate referral case required hospitalization, while received stable cases at recovery stage from the hospital ready to be received at CCTC in order to minimize at caseload at the hospital level.  Operationally the CCTC divided into three functioning areas this including: 
-	Observation area defined for highly suspected cases/ contact developed symptoms and undergoing laboratory confirmation test and provision of basic supportive therapy.
-	Isolation and case management area runs by health workers to provide medical assessment and supportive therapy to confirm COVID-19 infected mild cases.
-	Recovery area to accommodate the cases under medical supervision until the COVID-19 laboratory test converted to negative. After that, the final assessment and preparation for discharge will be conducted for the cases. 

The specific objectives for this project are:
-	To reduce the spread of the COVID-19 infection in the area of Maart Tamsrin, Salqin and Al-Baba
-	To manage the suspected COVID-19 patients and provide community-based isolation service for the suspected and the confirmed cases. 
-	To provide medical consultation, oxygen therapy, and drugs for COVID-19 cases.

Main activities: 
-	Procurement and provision of medicines, consumables medical supplies including the personal protective equipment, logistics supplies, cleaning material and stationery, waste management, maintenance, fuel, other supplies essential for the facility to function and provide standard quality health services.
-	Recruitment of the professional management and medical staff required to manage the CCTCs&#x2019; implementation activities (10 medical doctors, 30 nurses, 100+ essential staff support for 3 CCTs) 
-	Establishing one CCTC in Al-Bab including WASH infrastructure and the in-patient wards buildings. while this centre is completed, the staff will be working in a temporary facility rehabbed by WATAN in Al-Bab to be able to start the activities in the first month of the project.
-	Operate the CCTCs (Maart Masrin, Salqin, AlBab) with full services (case management, isolation for the suspected and confirmed cases, oxygen therapy, supportive treatment) This will be under direct supervision, to ensure the quality of the healthcare services based on WHO standard guidelines and treatment protocols.
-	Coordinating with the ACU team to facilitate the sample collection in the centre. 

Name of the facilities and type of support and HeRMS Code:  
-	Maart Tamsrin CCTC. (CCTC-21)
-	Salqin CCTC. (CCTC-24)
-	Al-Baba CCTC. (CCTC-34)</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to respond to the most urgent needs identified by the cluster and health directorate, where the targeted intervention is built on the dire need of high severity areas in NWS and will provide life-saving and life-sustaining humanitarian assistance to people in need. The project will apply facility-based approach in providing quality isolation and case management services and will contribute to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and decrease morbidity and mortality through filling critical and life-saving gaps in response to COVID-19 outbreak.
Within the beginning of COVID19 response, SEMA applied to the reserve allocation of SCHF to establish a specialized hospital for case management of moderate and severe cases that could be faced during the pandemic, with complete coordination with Health cluster, COVID19 TF, and case management TWG, thus, Idleb Isolation Hospital (Known as Karlton), a central hospital for COVID19 in NWS, located in Idleb City, which is considered as one of the biggest eight referral facilities for COVID19 in NWS according to Idleb Health Directorate, WHO and COVID19 Taskforce, with the capacity of ( 60 ward beds, 10 ICU beds, 10 Ventilators, Laboratory Dep, X-Ray Dep, 62 employees ) got born out and supported until 15 Jan 2021.
SEMA, under the successful partnership with SCHF, aims to complement and build on the impact and learnt lessons of the current project (the dire need to increase the staff number as the nature of this project differs from other health projects and there was a high pressure and over-load on the staff where SEMA responded to that by hiring additional staff from the private fund) by supporting one of the key isolation hospitals in Idleb governorate which witnesses an explosion in the registered suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases.
The Hospital received up to 10 Nov 2020: 254 COVID-19 patients: 106 Ward men, 34 ICU men, 83 Ward women, 7 ICU women, and it has been reported to the COVID19 TF and Idleb health directorate on daily basis. As NWS is entering to the first peak of the epidemic, the hospital currently is considered as a very crucial facility to be supported, as, since 10/10/2020, the percentage of occupations of ICU beds is not lower than 90%, and the general percentage of occupations is around 83% on average. Under this project, SEMA is planning to increase the capacity of the hospital to cope with the increasing needs by increasing the number of staff and supplying the hospital with 10 ICU beds, 10 CPAP devices, and PT device for ICU patients.
The project also will raise the capacity of staff in dealing with moderate and severe cases, in addition to activating tele&#x2013;medicine through 11 ICU specialists from SEMA advisors around the world, who will follow up the cases periodically.
The hospital is linked to the referral system of the Idleb Health Directorate, where there is constant coordination between health centers and isolation hospitals.
Severe cases, whom could be decided to be in need for isolation hospitals, are accepted according to the vacancy and the case status either in the ward or in the ICU. There are about 45 ambulances distributed over Idleb governorate and its countryside where 10 of these ambulances are equipped with mobile ventilators.
The Health Directorate coordinates admissions among the health facilities, CCTGs and isolation hospitals through WhatsApp groups.
When the patient (tested positive) arrives at the hospital by ambulance s/he enters the triage room and the physician examines and evaluates him and he requests x-rays and medical analysis, and if the case is suspected, a special triage form and an admission file are filled out, vital signs and analysis are recorded in the file, medicine is prescribed, then the patient&apos;s condition is monitored by physicians and nurses until he is discharged from the hospital.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Respond to COVID-19 Pandemic Through Supporting CCTCs</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to support 5 COVID Community Treatment Centers (CCTCs) for 8 months, which are the most effective ones out of the 13 centers currently functional and operated by UOSSM.
These centers provide services for treating mild and moderate cases of COVID-19, as they are considered the largest percentage of confirmed cases, ensuring that only the severe cases in which the morbidity is high reach out to the case management hospitals and ICU. 
The intervention in the project aims to address the gap in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in northwestern Syria (northwest rural Aleppo and Idlib) by supporting CCTCs, where surveys will be conducted for all suspected cases of COVID-19 that meet the criteria for the swab (PCR) to be taken and If it confirmed, mild and moderate cases will be admitted, quarantined and treated ( except that are asymptomatic with suitable home circumstances for quarantines ), thus containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and reducing morbidity and mortality rates.
The project also includes educating patients and teaching them how to use personal protective equipment and training them in practice.
These centers are located in Kafr Karmin, Atma, Sarmada, Armanaz, and Dana, which are in the hot area of OCHA allocation and have a population of (998861 for Dana District), 74430 for Armanaz District, and 176282 for Atarep District).
The WHO indicated on August 14, 2020, that studies are varied about Covid morbidity, In any case, global studies indicate that approximately 20 - 40% of positive cases asymptomatic while, 60 - 80% symptomatic (  5% of them needs ICU, 15% hospitalization, and 80%  CCTCs ).
According to the statistics of the previous 5 CCTCs, length of stay (Los), and the capacity, the number of beneficiaries was calculated at 333 per month for each center (1665 for 5 CCTC centers)The center will be as WHO/HC model that include 4 areas:
1-	Triage (first acceptance area in which application filled and IPC s provided) 
2-	Screening and physical evaluation in which admission, referral or home quarantine decision will take 
3-	Observation and isolation in which admitted cases 
4-	Recovery when patient prepared to discharge.

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Takaful through this project aims to meet the basic needs of heating items to the most vulnerable in Idleb and Aleppo camps by providing them with seasonal NFIs through restricted e-vouchers for 3 months in addition to establish fire points and raising awareness about the fire hazards, prevention and mitigation procedures in the same camps .
The project will target 3233 HHs 16165 individuals (3718 men 3880 women 4849 boys 3718 girls) as follow:
Azaz 1409 HHs (Alrayan) Camp
Dana 1185 HHs (Al Salam, Al-Ahmad, Abnaa alziara, Al Wdahee, Aldarraj, Maarrat Dibsah) Camps
Atareb 639 HHs (Al Raay, Batebo, Ziytan , Al Tal) Camps
Interventions will target the same beneficiaries as follow: 
NFI
Distributing e-voucher with $150 value to redeem it with heating items for 3 months, where monthly $50 will be loaded.
Firstly, Takaful will conduct meetings with local actors to ensure their participation in the project. 
The fuel vendors will be selected according to certain criteria. As we already work with e-voucher vendors in some of the targeted locations in another project funded by HF , that will support our efficient and fast implementation for this project.
Beneficiaries will be selected among the most vulnerable (male-female).
The voucher distribution will be on pre-identified dates and in safe points with easy access.
Instead of physical training, as a response to Covid, an explanatory video will be prepared and shared with benes, includes how to redeem vouchers, vendors&apos; names and addresses, WtsApp number for complaints, in addition to banners describes the redemption process and vendors&#x2019; information.
After ensuring that the beneficiaries have redeemed their vouchers from the vendors, the value of the items will be paid to the vendors.
For HHs who face difficulties in reaching the markets, we will deliver their vouchers to their locations, and giving them the chance to choose kinds of provided items they prefer and then delivering it to their locations.
We chose the voucher modality as it is easier to use and follow up, and gives the beneficiaries the choice to buy what they want from multiple vendors to avoid the risks of fuel storage, where the beneficiaries will visit the selected vendors shops and choose the heating items they need.
CCCM
We will establish fire response committee (males and females) in the targeted camps in order to mitigate the risks of occurring fire, in addition to best response to fire when it occur. We will provide capacity development to committees and camp management staff to response to fire through the training on using of fire response items. In addition, Takaful team will prepare an awareness video and e-brochures explaining the prevention advices to avoid fire, and how to use fire response items in case fire occurred to raise the awareness of camp residents.
In coordination with camps&#x2019; management and fire response committees in targeted camps, fire points will be putted in suitable locations, where each 140 tents will be provided with fire point includes fire response items
The trained committees will transfer the training to the camps&#x2019; residents. 
We will insist on prevention procedures for COVID-19 before, during and after the distribution, including distancing, procedures of sterilization staff and beneficiaries, awareness posters, crowds management, sterilizing DPs according to WASH amp health cluster&#x2019;s recommendations in addition to allocate an employee to monitor and make sure that all COVID-19 prevention procedures were applied.
We will coordinate with CCCM and NFI clusters and other organizations to avoid any duplication. 
The project will ensure equal access for both genders with priority for women, children headed household, PwD, sick and elderly in addition the project staff female and male members trained on the protection and gander equality</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Scale up of Winterization Response in NW Syria 2020-2021</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">**Mercy-USA for Aid and Development in this project will support internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host community in Afrin, Jandairis, and Dana sub-districts with winterization support in the form of in-kind, eco-friendly biofuel, and stove kits

Total number of beneficiaries who will be targeted 3567 HH - 17880 individuals (Men 3592- Women 3929 Boys 4822- Girls 5537) by using in-kind modality for implementation for the most vulnerable households. Mercy-USA will target each household with in-kind 750 kg of olive pit fuel (250 kg per month) throughout the winter months (December 2020, January 2021 and February 2021). The initial fuel distribution will occur along with the stoves&#x2019; distribution or shortly after distributing the stoves to 100% of the targeted households to ensure all beneficiaries have the appropriate stoves to use olive-pit fuel

The Shelter NFI cluster recommendations at minimum 750kg/ HH/ 3 months, however, based on many PDM conducted by Mercy-USA after each winterization project since 2015. Always the quantity is not enough for beneficiaries given the fact of harsh winter seasons in the last few years in NW Syria, so as lesson learned, we increased the distributed quantity per HH to be total (750 kg/ HH/ 3months)

Mercy-USA will distribute olive-pit fuel to the beneficiaries directly on monthly allotments based on monthly distribution plan by specifying dates for each location.

The implementation plan is the same in Afrin and Jandairis will be the same, however, Considering the beneficiaries are identified and verified in Jandairis, it is assumed distribution can start earlier in Jandairis communities

**Mercy-USA will distribute masks and soap along with stoves and fuel to the same beneficiaries to ensure protective measures against COVID-19 are in place without doing harm. each HH will receive five mask and 700 gram of soap on monthly basis. Soap will be donated by IRC to Mercy-USA in order to be distributed along with fuel as in integrated response and complementarity approach while masks will be purchased by Mercy-USA

**Accountability to Affected population (AAP) will be given high priority in this project by communications and sharing information with beneficiaries during all project phases, as well as using complaints and feedback mechanism which is accessible to all beneficiaries especially the most vulnerable such as persons with disabilities, the elderly, women and girls, thus taking corrective actions based on need.

** Furthermore, MEAL plan will be for all project stages such as verification of vulnerability assessment, distribution monitoring, PDM, with using different MEAL tools.

**Reporting will be on timely basis according to the priority, ex, narrative report will be interim and final, while other reports will be on a weekly basis.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of life-saving winterization support to the IDPs in Al harakat and Aljabal camps in Ghandorah and Jarablus.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Summary:
Through this project, Binaa organization seeks to provide support and to response to 2,199 conflict affected IDP HHs (11,174 individuals) (2,305 women, 1,976 men, 3,183 girls and 3,710 boys) in both Aljabl and Haraqat camps in Jarablus and Gandoura villages throughout providing stoves, and sufficient heating fuel for 3 months as per 4 liters for the day.
through this support Binaa will ensures the integration of the food security response and the winter needs response, while Binaa is already providing bread for the all the families in these camps on daily basis since Oct 2020 and that will extend to March 2020 under one of SCHF ongoing project. 
Each beneficiary household will receive stove and diesel for 3 months based on 4 liter per day, Total 360 liter, the diesel will be packed in jerrycans, (Heaters, Diesel, and jerrycans specifications are attached to the proposal (Attachment T 01)
Binaa will distribute 3 patches of fuel, the first one (120 liters) will be in December 2020 and it will be conjugated with stoves distribution, the second one (120 liters) will be in January 2021, and third one (120 liters) will be in February 2021, according to the time plan of the project (Attachment A 01).
The distribution will be in kind at the main distribution points and the quality of the diesel will be checked before distribution, however, the fuel kits will be delivered to the elderly (over 60 years old), people with special needs, and the people who are unable to reach the distribution point for any reason directly to their house (door to door) that will decrease the risk of COVID 19 on the elderly people.
Verification visits (100% of beneficiaries) will be conducted after each distribution to ensure that the beneficiaries are still available to receive the next batch and ensure that they are using the heaters and fuel.
Binaa will follow the SNFI recommended procedures for the distributing of NFIs during COVID-19 in addition to follow Binaa guidance in this regard (Attachment A 02), the following are some of these procedures:
	Preventive measures will be taken to ensure social separation and availability of enough area, that will reduce the risk of spreading of COVID-19, the plan for the distribution point which will be equipped with cones and plastic chains to regulate the entry and exit process is attached to the proposal (Attachment T 03).
	The team will share the distribution plan with the camp management and will inform the beneficiaries a day before the distribution process, and the beneficiaries will be divided into groups to ensure less gathering of the people, however, cards will be given to each beneficiary with the time and date of receipt.
	Beneficiaries will be advised to leave the distribution location moment they receive assistance, they will not pass through the distribution point more than once.
	Binaa will distribute masks to the beneficiaries HHs (5 for each one) as per SNFI guidance for COVID 19, that will be done with each fuel distribution.
Awareness sessions will come along with verification/distribution activities , these awareness sessions will focus on  2 main topics, 1- the best procedures for dealing with fires, 2- COVID-19 awareness (following proper hygiene practices, Covid-19 spread, pandemic symptoms, and the ways to deal with it in case of getting the disease),  beneficiaries will be provided with the numbers of emergency/actors that can deal with the cases, (the list is attached to the proposal (Attachment A 03)).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated WASH and ERL response to the negative effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on the affected communities in NWS</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our response will focus mainly on two sectors, WASH and ERL where we seek through this integrated response to reduce the risks of the Covid 19 pandemic among the already affected people. Our strategy depends on innovative intervention to confront the economic and social impacts of Covid 19 and limit its spread and its effects on the vulnerable people, where the water, sanitation and hygiene package is designed to limit the spread of the Covid 19 and change the wrong and unhealthy hygienic practices and provide the needed personal items that will protect people and enhance their personal hygiene, while the ERL packages will work to help vulnerable people to overcome the negative economic and social results left by the spread of the Covid 19 beside the Syrian crisis through the provision of short-term labour opportunities to skilled and unskilled workers supporting 180 HHs Who will mainly responsible for producing around 155520 reusable masks through the cash for work that will be implemented.
Silk Road will establish (3 ) workshops equipped with the necessary equipment to produce these masks as well as some women will participate from their homes if any (Women have a Sewing machine), while the organization will secure all other materials needed for the production of the masks. The workshops will be in Batenta, Maaret Elekhwan and Kafr Karmin and the main beneficiaries will be selected from these locations. Silk Road will seek to use existing workshops if any and in case it is not possible then we will go to establish new workshops knowing that this will not cost a lot and will not take a long time as well.
The produced masks beside soap that will be secured by the organization will be packed in boxes or bags and this package will be distributed to the beneficiaries in two ways (The first by the hygiene promoters when they visit the family and the second by the head of the family who can come to the workshop to pick up the package). The sewing machines will be handed over to the number of families after the project ends ( Kind of sustainability of the project under an agreement with women, standers and criteria for selection). Silk Road will select the most vulnerable women (Families with no income generation) in each targeted community and we will prioritize IDPs, women ith disabilities, and women-headed household also we will take into our consideration the size of the family and persons he has the ability to work if any. Silk Road will study each case before producing the final list and we will transparently work with the community. Also, once we select the women, we will sign an agreement with them to ensure the rights of each party.
The approach that we will follow in implementing WASH intervention to achieve the desired goals will be based on providing the needed safe drinking water to people as well as support and manage waste collection systems to maintain a safe and clean environment in addition to distributing hygiene personal supplies (Soap +Masks (4 per person) that helps reduce the spread of the Covid 19 epidemic, in addition to re-usable face masks that we will provide through early recovery activities that we will support. These activities will be accompanied by awareness-raising activities that will be provided by the hygiene promoters who will be assigned in each targeted communities(Two in each one). During this period of support (Operation of the water systems), a cost recovery system will be established to ensure continuous cash flow required for running the systems during and after the project (Only the first two months of the project will be supported 100% while the others will be partly supported), this will involve a study on a suitable tariff rate that takes into account the dwindling financial capacity of the benefiting population and will be based on focus group discussions with a representative group of the community including members of local councils of targeted communities.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In recognition of the risks and urgent needs associated with outbreak of COVID-19 and increasing IDP population in NW Syria, CARE will leverage its technical leadership, operational experience, financial resources to provide coordinated assistance to conflict-affected communities, especially the newly displaced one living in Jarablus district. CARE aims to implement WASH activities to mitigate the risk of COVID-19, including increasing hygiene promotion, mass COVID-19 messaging at camps level, providing an increased amount of required clean water to facilitate handwashing practices. CARE will increase the amount of water to 35 L/person/day, reaching 15,250 beneficiaries. Additionally, CARE will work to encourage and facilitate this practice for targeted people living in camps and in communities and will distribute cleaning/disinfecting materials and soap through awareness-raising and behavior change activities. 

CARE proposes to support 3,050 HHs living in Old and New Zoghara Camps located in Jarablus with WASH services in this project. The camps were built by AFAD in 2017 to host IDPs fleeing conflict areas in NW Syria. Through the funds from the first standard allocation 2020, CARE extended the new camp to host 1,200 HHs in addition to the 1,850 HHs living in the old camp and improved lifesaving conditions by replacing damaged tents with new ones, insulating tents and implementing graveling and ground site preparation in addition to securing safe access to WASH facilities in consideration of COVID-19 precaution measures.

The camps are among locations with high reported cases of COVID-19. 104 cases have been recorded in the camp. CARE in coordination with the stakeholders has completed the establishment and set up process of a quarantine zone at new Zoghra camp. The quarantine zone consists of 50 tents facilitated with NFIs. Public WASH facilities have been prepared with equipment to serve the quarantine area. CARE has ensured that the quarantine zone is isolated from the camp&#x2019;s remaining sectors by selecting the appropriate location and having it separated with a surrounding fence. Local authorities hold responsibility of providing necessary medical equipment and staff.

Access to water is essential for effective handwashing, which is one of the most important measures to prevent COVID-19 infection. CARE will work on securing safe access to adequate drinking water by operating water stations, providing the camp with water (35 L/P/D), provide water storage tanks for IDPs and to reduce crowdedness around current distribution points. CARE will conduct full water quality analyses on water sources in advance. Trucked water will be chlorinated and FRC levels will be checked daily throughout the entire supply chain.

Essential emergency services such as desludging, latrines, soap provision will be provided. To reduce overcrowding, improve hygiene behaviors and increase access to handwashing facilities, CARE will install new shared family latrines where Sphere standards are not met (one toilet for every 20 people), installing door locks for safety and privacy and providing appropriate lighting. CARE will also undertake minor repairs to existing latrines including quick fixes of handwashing facilities in particular and cleaning of latrines, including disinfecting communally used surfaces to mitigate COVID-19 infection risk.

For the prevention and control of infections, CARE will apply intensive hygiene promotion sessions. CARE&#x2019;s hygiene volunteers will be in charge of disinfection measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in camps. Disinfection kits including soap and PPE will be distributed along with one-off hygiene kits to all families in the camp. Volunteers will be assigned to sterilizing latrines, water distribution points and WASH equipment such as water tankers using the provided cleaning materials and disinfectant liquid.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Rapid Response to WASH Gaps to Prevent Suppress and Interrupt Transmission of  COVID-19 in Idleb City.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project addresses the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in densely populated areas of Idleb sub-district ranked as high in severity of WASH needs. The proposed action will contain the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic and decrease morbidity and mortality through providing rapid, life-saving Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services to vulnerable, underserved and at risk communities. 

Planned activities respond directly to gaps in WASH service provision which have been jointly identified with the WASH cluster. These are made further more critical by the high risk of COVID-19 in Idleb sub-district, specifically in the dense, over-populated areas targeted in Idleb City. Informed by Big Hearts operational experience with WASH service provision in Idleb City, complementary to our ongoing interventions and designed in full coordination with other actors, the action will scale up water provision and enable improved COVID-19 prevention and response.  

The project will benefit a total of 60,500 conflict affected people living in the Al Gazl station and Street 30 borehole catchment areas of Idleb City. Of these, 28,030 direct beneficiaries are Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), 30,854 are female and 33,274 are children. 

The action will prevent, suppress and interrupt transmission of COVID-19 through increasing and safeguarding access to safe water in areas with identified gaps. Provision of operational and maintenance support to the Street 30 borehole will begin in Dec 2020, meeting the gap in service provision since Big Hearts previous SCHF-funded support to Street 30 ended in Sept 2020. Complementing ongoing SDC-funded assistance, the project will maintain vital operational and maintenance support to the Al Gazl station from February 2021 when SDC funding will close. In coordination with SEMA, WASH services will be improved in two, existing COVID-19 quarantine centers located in the Al Gazl catchment area through connecting these to the primary water network. 

In addition to ensuring access to safe water and informed by Big Hearts participation in established COVID-19 coordination structures, Risk Communication and Community Education (RCCE) activities will be delivered across targeted communities in close coordination with UNDR and Violet. This will include highly targeted distribution of hygiene and sanitation materials (soap, detergents and cloth masks) directly benefitting 17,500 people most vulnerable to the pandemic. The targeting strategy for this component with be informed by close coordination with the COVID-19 Task Force and other members to identify areas with higher C-19 case numbers and areas with dense / inadequate shelter. Vulnerability targeting will then identify households most at risk amp least able to practice positive prevention practices. 

A people-centered approach lies at the heart of the intervention. Programme design reflects the needs, priorities and preferences of beneficiaries identified through monitoring and evaluation of Big Hearts WASH assistance in Idleb City since October 2019. Design of the action also addresses feedback and recommendations from Third Party Monitoring (TPM) of Big Hearts SCHF-funded WASH programming in Idleb City. Specifically, recommendations made to the WASH cluster to assess the possibility of continuing projects to close the water supply gap in Idleb City and increase the number of water tanks distributed. Recommendations regarding gender segregated hygiene promotion activities have already been implemented across Big Hearts WASH programme and will apply to this action, while beneficiary feedback on means to further enhance accountability will also be progressed. 

The action is informed by recent technical assessments of targeted water systems completed by Big Heart WASH staff (included under documents) and significant operational experience with both water systems. As such, proposed activities are evidence-based, technically sound and accurately budgeted.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will support cross-border operations from Turkey into Syria to tap into sources of information and share it for use by the humanitarian community through a team of humanitarian field officers in NSAG-controlled areas. The team will be managed by the HFOs management team based in Gaziantep, Turkey in consultation with OCHA Turkey. The project is designed to broadly support the formal coordination system, especially the clusters/ICCG, as It is based on four pillars.

1-Information gathering
This pillar focuses on gathering data from the ground to produce reports about the humanitarian situation and context and inform response and advocacy. The data is shared with the OCHA coordination unit for use in various platforms and products. Info on unmet needs, including urgent cases, will be shared with clusters to address
2-Support to monitoring of SCHF funded projects.
The HFOs will monitor projects funded by the SCHF. These monitoring missions will be conducted upon the request of the SCHF and based on SCHF monitoring criteria. Monitoring of SCHF projects directly improves the quality and accountability of the inter-cluster response, as projects funded by the SCHF are reviewed through the clusters. The HFAs will also receive a training on MampE tools and methods to ensure accurate and relevant information are gathered by them.

3-Community Engagement
The HFOs will conduct community engagement to strengthen humanitarian response through facilitating meetings with the affected community and the humanitarian community and other stakeholders obtaining feedback from the community on their needs and the response and providing information to affected people through awareness sessions and other means on the humanitarian response and the community&#x2019;s rights and role in it. Community engagement informs the overall inter-cluster response and in some cases is organized on behalf of clusters.

4-Service Mapping
The existing service map app for mobile phones will get an upgrade to ensure ease of use and better accessibility such as &#x201C;text-to-speech&#x201D; for visually impaired people, and more visually-illustrated materials to assist people with reading/writing difficulties. The app will include a virtual information center that will 1)work as an awareness platform disseminating information on key issues such as AAP, COVID-19, and CHS  2)create an accessible repository of information for all affected persons and humanitarian actors to receive support and information to avoid duplication. 

The project builds on the outcomes of a previous project completed earlier in 2021. The information-gathering component is well-established and in recent months the mechanism for sharing specific needs data with clusters was streamlined and has resulted in individual cases receiving assistance. SCHF monitoring activities carried out so far have been well-received, resulting in one of the HFOs becoming largely dedicated to this work and the processes for monitoring becoming more formalized which will be further enhanced. Direct engagement with communities facilitated by the HFOs has allowed senior leadership, including the ERC, to provide high-level advocacy from key constituencies including women and PWDs. The service map app is now available in four languages and hosts over than 2,600 distributed between medical, educational emergency, and other types of services. It is also hosting ads from humanitarian actors, and hundreds of people have registered seeking for training. The app has been well received by people in need, clusters, and other stakeholders. Building on this success, BampZ is planning to conduct a promotion campaign to promote the service map application to ensure it is used by the relevant stakeholders as much as possible. A handover plan will also be set to shift the support of the app to another donor to ensure its sustainability.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting provision of healthcare services through procurement and prepositioning of essential medicine and medical supplies to northwest Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will strengthen access to lifesaving and life-sustaining essential health services within COVID-19 response through procurement of WHO pipeline of PPE supplies to support provision of integrated primary and secondary health care services to the vulnerable population of northwestern Syria. 
The goal of the project is to assist in procurement and preposition of the medical supplies into the warehouse inside NWS from the WHO pipeline (list of supplies is available as Annex 2) available through the Global Supply portal. According to identified needs WHO is planning to organize direct procurement of medical supplies from the Global Market focusing on specialized emergency health kits, including Inter-agency Emergency Health Basic Kits (IEHK), TESK and NCD kits from WHO Global Emergency Stock in Dubai to be distributed among health facilities in Idleb and Aleppo governates. Regarding COVID-19 response in northwestern Syria WHO will procure supplies both for the laboratories aiming to support surveillance system (laboratory Testing Kits, N95 respirators, and Gown) and health facilities providing specializes medical care to COVID-19 patients through intensive care units (ICU) for confirmed COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms and underlying chronic conditions. 

To ensure that these supplies will arrive shortly into NWS, WHO is planning to purchase part of the supplies in Turkey and deliver to Syria immediately since they are under critical demand. Other supplies will be purchased from the available WHO Dubai stock of life-saving supplies and will be based on the existing needs and availability of supplies in Dubai. 

Preposition of the procured medicine and medical supplies would be organized through two warehouses in Syria in Aleppo and Idleb governorates, which are operated by two contracted NGOs which will facilitate the distribution of these supplies to the organizations who are managing the health facilities to receive supplies. These are in-kind donations to the health facilities and WHO will not be having services except for logistics and warehouses. Otherwise, all active health cluster partners have been invited to the WHO supply line forum and may get donated supplies to ones who are prioritized based on the need during the months of distribution. The costs of warehousing and logistics will be covered through other WHO funds and will not be charged to this current project. 

As well it is worth mentioning that considering the risk of non-renewal of the UN Security Council Resolution it is planned to deliver all goods to NWS before July 10, 2021, and ensure health service continuity,</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhance Safe Access to Formal Education Services for School-Aged-Children in The Underserved and High-Needs Areas of Atareb, Dana, Darkosh, and Qourqeena Sub-districts</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention&apos;s overall objective is to improve equitable access for school-aged children to safe, inclusive, and quality learning environments to foster their resilience. This will be achieved through implementing a package of education activities to 19 formal schools in Atareb, Dana, Darkosh, and Qourqeena sub-districts which are located in underserved and high-needs areas, where11,766 children (5,581 boys and 6,185 girls &apos;including 302 CwD ~2.5%&apos;, 5-17 years old) are enrolled (65% IDPs). The project builds on previous projects&apos; successes, funded by Save the Children, UNICEF, and SCHF. The proposed schools need funding for the time being. So, there will be a big chance for 11,766 school-aged children to lose their education opportunities in addition to 480 education personnel who will lose their only source of income in case these schools aren&#x2019;t supported. By supporting a quality learning environment, IRD seeks to increase children&apos;s enrollment in the targeted schools. To achieve this, IRD will conduct digital Back To Learning (BTL) campaigns &apos;to minimize gathering and as a precautionary measure for COVID-19&apos; in 14 communities for raising awareness among parents and community members regarding the importance of education. All enrolled students will receive formal education services using the SiG curriculum for 9 months (Sep 21 to May 22). 20% of these students will conduct ASER tests twice. The baseline will be conducted during October 2021 and the end line will be conducted during April 2022 to measure the learning outcomes of the project on students. To improve the students&#x2019; well-being during the project lifetime, all enrolled students will receive recreational activities from their classroom teachers. All teachers will be provided with monthly incentives to increase their motivation and ensure their retention in schools. The project will cover the schools&#x2019; monthly operational costs, including recreational materials, refreshment, cleaning, hygiene materials, and stationery, conducting light repairs for schools, provision of students&apos; and teachers&apos; kits. The quality of education will be improved through contextualized and targeted teacher training and further support to their professional development within each school by delivering (CSG, TiCC, PSEA, COVID-19) trainings. IRD will cover the costs of these trainings from another funding. Parents Teachers Associations (PTAs) will be a component in the activities of this project. Quarterly meetings for PTAs members will be held to discuss what was achieved in the last period and set with IRD&#x2019;s staff plans for the upcoming period. Due to COVID-19, there will be comprehensive precautionary measures in the 19 schools, including periodic sterilization process for classrooms and WASH facilities, awareness sessions for students, training for teachers and educational staff, and sterilization provision materials for all schools. IRD will re-utilize all the preexisted IT equipment (laptops and printers) from its previous various education projects.

Plan B: 
All schools are now operational. In case of COVID-19 out-break again, schools may be suspended and close temporarily. As a plan B, the project will adapt the distance learning modality tested during 2020 through 4 education projects implemented by IRD and provide children with internet vouchers (which will be covered from running costs). WhatsApp groups will be created per subject and per class. Teachers will prepare their lessons and record the lessons to be shared with students.
In case there will be a part-time suspension, the blended education approach will be applied. It is a mix of physical attendance and distance learning methods.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Scaled-up access to basic food needs in high-needs and underserved areas by providing cash for food and food voucher assistance and creating livelihood opportunities for communities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project targets 4 communities in Suran&#x2013;Aleppo, Azaz and Aghtrin sub-districts, all these camps located in underserved areas, the project consists of two sectors that complement each other:

1- Under FSL: The project target 1123 families with 8 rounds of regular (monthly) food assistance:
- Cash for food: GAN will target 1123 families in camps with cash for food, the cash intervention is feasible in these camps as they all have access to different main markets in the targeted communities, eight rounds of cash for food will be distributed between Jul 2021 to Mar 2022, each round consists of two phases, 20 days for distribution and 10 days for validation and PDM, 60$ will be allocated for each family as recommended by FSL cluster and CWG, GAN conducted a deep coordination with different partners working in the same area as detailed in the coordination section, although the data gained form the FSL cluster indicate this areas as high priority ranking and no partner plan to target the same vulnerable and underserved camps, according to the interviews and assessment, 94% said that the first priority is food, the proposed modality is a cash for food, as it is considered one of the most effective modality since the markets are available near camps.
Monthly market assessment in terms of availability of the items, prices, and accessibility will be conducted to ensure the local markets are functioning and all beneficiaries have good and equal accessibility to the different goods.

2- Under ERL: GAN through its sub-implementing partner (POINT organization) aims to integrate its intervention and target same affected and most severe communities, IDPs and host communities who are till now relying on aids through provision of livelihood opportunities. The selection of targeted beneficiaries under this ERL component will be from the list of the FSL beneficiaries that will be supported in this FSL intervention and the ones that were supported in the previous FSL project currently being finalized by GAN (SCHF 16291) according to an eligibility and vulnerability criteria with giving priorities to higher vulnerability scores and women headed HHs and PWDs in order to provide a comprehensive integrated intervention.

This will be done by starting with Market mapping to identify market gaps and needs according to which the VT training topics and domains will be identified, then GAN and POINT will start several advocacy and community sensitization activities that aims at engaging the communities, explaining the merits of the intervention and the idea of SMEs, raising awareness of the importance of sustaining small businesses, and clearly communicating the selection criteria in order to reduce the risk of tensions among communities.

After that, the selected beneficiaries will be verified and then will be invited to join the vocational training which will target 100 persons and last for two months on topics that will be identified according to the market mapping with giving priorities to vocations related to PPEs production and other locally produced general covid19 protection related items such as hygiene items.
After finishing the VT, Point will deliver SME trainings of five days each for the successful applicants considering their attendance percentage in the VT, tests results and trainers&#x2019; evaluations, during this SMEs, the participants will learn about basis of business establishment, marketing financial study, feasibility, competition evaluation.. etc. after that, each participant will submit a business plan which will be evaluated by a formed committee for this purpose.
Each successful business plan with the highest scores will be supported with cash grants of 1200$ for the first 78 best plans to be paid on three tranches.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Regular E-vouchers Food Assistance and MPCA for the most vulnerable people in NW Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">**Mercy-USA will target 1799 households in Maaret Tamsrin camps with life-saving and life-sustaining food assistance.

The project consists of two components:
1-Regular food assistance through value based E-Vouchers modality, each HH will receive value 60 USD monthly for 8 months along with the FSL and CWG recommendations to cover the Kcal needs for these households to be aligned with the food component in the SMEB. 
The E-Vouchers value can be redeemed with list of food items from contracted markets/ shops in the same targeted areas.
 The beneficiaries in this component will be selected from IDPs who received RTER as response to the flood response in the last winter during January and February (including disabled, female headed households, women and young girls, PLW, and the elderly )
The targeted beneficiaries are 1299 HH (6495 individuals)  (Men 1299, Women 1429, Boys 1754, Girls 2013) (from them 625 disabled) 
Each voucher will be loaded with extra value to purchase 700 gram of soap monthly to be aligned with FSL and WASH cluster for prevention from COVID-19

2- Emergency unrestricted Cash 100 USD as one-off (Multipurpose Cash) for households who affected by any emergencies such as displacement, flood, wind, fire,,,etc 
 500 HH (2500 individuals) (Men 500, Women 550, Boys 675, Girls 775) (from them 250 disabled)

This intervention is fully aligned with the allocation strategy and FSLamp CWG  recommendations by:

**Mercy-USA is proposing to contract service provider for the E-vouchers in Turkey to be sub-contracted with markets in the targeted locations, these e-vouchers to be distributed one time for the beneficiaries and to be redeemed regularly on monthly basis. 
**Accountability to affected population will be given high priority by transparent beneficiary selection criteria, as well ad Complaints and Feedback mechanism which will be in place and accessible to all people through different channels.
** Mercy-USA will have MEAL plan in place in order to monitor the whole process starting from the vulnerability assessment, redemption/ distribution monitoring and post distribution monitoring with corrective measure to be taken on timely manner to ensure continuous improvement of the project implementation in order to reach the planned objectives 
**Mercy-USA considers the coordination is key aspect to apply complimentary and integration approach by coordination with other NGOs in Maaret Tamsrin Camps  in other services as well as complement with other Mercy-USA projects. 
**Disability inclusion is high priority for Mercy-USA, so many core staff were hired disabled to ensure the inclusion and design all projects by include their perspectives to incorporate inclusion in all phases of projects</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project pursuits scaling-up efforts to sustain minimum food consumption needs of the most vulnerable IDPs and host community population in western rural of Aleppo province.
This intervention will complement our ongoing project and will make big contribution towards addressing the critical food insecurity and instability of the IDPs in the camps through distribution of free bread as well as supporting the livelihood assets through supporting the wheat value chain and access to agriculture.
MASRRAT will Support the local wheat value chain through marketing, wherein MASRRAT has an ongoing project supporting 600 wheat farmers beneficiaries in Aleppo countryside (funded by OCHA). So, MASRRAT will purchase 360 tons of wheat seeds with supported price from the beneficiaries and other farmers (600 kg from each farmer) based on specific criteria for ensuring the pureness of the wheat. The purchased wheat will be used as follows:
1. 240 tons of the purchased wheat will be milled to produce 192 tons of wheat flour and 48 tons of wheat bran (80% + 20% of the purchased wheat seeds) and supply flour directly to bakeries and provide free bread distribution (175.8 tons white bread and 55 tons of bran bread) to 2400 of the most vulnerable IDP HHs for four consecutive months in the targeted locations whose access to subsidized bread is limited. Wherein, MASRRAT will contract with four bakeries to increase the community participation and reduce work pressure and to ensure that the bakeries will not exceed the daily production capacity which will affect the bread quality (part of the resulted wheat bran will be used to cover the costs of milling the wheat flour).
2. The other part of the purchased wheat seeds (120 tons will produce 114 tons of pure wheat after screening, 5% impurities) will be used for improving access to agriculture by distributing it to 456 new wheat farmers. Every beneficiary will receive 250 kg of wheat seeds, one fuel voucher for supplementary irrigation 125 $ as well as three technical training sessions about GAP. The beneficiaries of wheat activity will be from the local community and IDPs who settled for a while, own or renting land between 7 to10 donums suitable for wheat, as well as the farmers who meet the selection criteria.
This project will support 14420 beneficiaries affected by the Syrian crisis (3750 men, 3186 women, 3648 boys and 3835 girls including 303 PWDs) by promoting their accessibility to the humanitarian assistance significantly. All the people in the targeted villages and markets will benefit directly/indirectly from the project where the wheat will be available in the markets at normal prices. The project is designed with consideration to the cluster and WHO recommendation on prevention and mitigation measures related to COVID-19 especially during the distribution of support and conducting trainings. In addition, protection cluster recommendations were taken into consideration, wherein all the population in the targeted locations will benefit from MASRRAT protection Centers in Aleppo, in the event of any GBV referral cases.
The target villages in Jebel Samman district/Atareb sub-district are considered from the most densely populated areas:
Jeineh 6272 HCs amp 2580IDPs
Atareb 23950 HCs amp 8632IDPs
Kafr Karmin 7100 HCs amp 6000 IDPs
Babka 2800 HCs amp 1650 IDPs
Abin Samaan 12920 HCs amp 6257IDPs
Batbu 4800 HCs amp 5030 IDPs
Kafr Naseh Elatareb 3960 HCs amp 7491 IDPs</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of life-saving integrated activities including the food distribution to the most vulnerable families in Jarablus District</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is designed to scaled-up life-saving assistance, safe and continued access to basic essential services, and the improved protective environment particularly for vulnerable groups such as women and children (2100 HH, 10500 individuals) in Jarablous sub-district which is a high priority ranking in the allocation paper, by providing Life-saving humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on underserved areas with high severity of needs 
. The assistance will take place in 10 communities taking into consideration equity in access, quality, responsiveness and participation and resilience the intervention can be summarized as the following:
FSL Cluster: the project will cover the distribution of Food Rations (2100 FR) for 2500 HH settled in 10 communities for 8 months. These food rations which are according to FSL Cluster standards will be distributed once a month and for 8 months by informing the targeted HHs about the timing and the location as well, taking into consideration the COVID-19 preventive measures such as distributing PPE kits for the teams and distributing soap for the benefited families. This intervention is classified under ASO2
Beneficiaries will be selected based on the proposed vulnerability criteria as reflected below together with other eligibility criteria as determined as follows after coordination with the local authorities: 
have No food assistance from NGOs.
A household with a special needs member.
A household with an elderly member.
The number of children more than 2.
Women-headed HH, or households with a pregnant or lactating woman.
Families in need equal to or greater than 5 people 
The disaggregation of BNFs is as the following
For Male
Children (0-23mnths) 239
Children (24-59mnths) 478
Children (6-11 yrs) 970
Children (12 -17 yrs) 1180

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Scale-up efforts to sustain minimum food consumption needs of the most vulnerable IDPs through daily bread distribution for 18964 IDPs in camps in high and medium priority in Harim and Salqin areas for 7 months.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Without adequate resources and due to the general economic deterioration in northwest Syria, people in need have continued to resort. 
The proposed project aims to Scale-up efforts to sustain the most vulnerable IDPs&apos; minimum food consumption needs through Supply flour or bread directly to bakeries and provide free bread distribution in areas with limited access to subsidized bread in sub-districts in NW Syria. 

The proposed project will serve a total population of 18964. IDPs ( 4659 Men, 5191 women, 4760 Boys, and 4354 girls) in Harim (4.3 high priority area) and Salqin ( 3.9 Medium priority area) according to the 2021 1st allocation paper in 21 IDPs camps and settlements. 
The proposed project is a continuation of last year&apos;s SKT project in the same locations. SKT has access to IDPs&apos; information and needs. Thus, the proposed project will be a continuation of the cluster plan to support the food security of the most vulnerable groups in NWs. 
The target locations have not received any food assistance from the distributed free bread during the last 2 years. The proposed free bread distribution project is the only project that partially covers the daily 2100 calories needs of the target IDPs. Suspending these services will create a huge gap and will harm the food security of these IDPs. 

According to the needs assessment results and the coordination that SKT has implemented with the other key organizations in the same target area, and as addressing to 3PM recommendation, SKT will start increasing the weight of the bread bundles to 0.9 KG. The coordination has been made with NWS FSL cluster coordination, Goal organization, and Hand in Hand to improve the technical aspects of bread distribution activities. Further coordination was done with Insan, IHH, and Mercy without limits to ensure no duplication or overlapping in targeting IDPs.

 
SKT will conduct a procurement process for flour from inside Syria - as cluster and HF recommendation-  SKT team to be transferred to the bakery. SKT will provide the operational cost for the bakery for the flour to be baked. It will provide the nylon bags, each ton of flour will provide 1277 bread bundles with  900gr for each with criteria (900gr for each family with members of 5 and less and 1.8kg for each family with members of 6 and more daily). SKT will monitor transferring the bread from the bakery to the distribution points (5 distribution points) through special cars prepared for bread transferring to save the quality of the bread (the distance between the bakery and the distribution points will not be more than 7 km maximum and the distance between each distribution point and the targeted beneficiaries will not be more than 1 km maximum), the volunteer will monitor and supervise the distribution process, a monitoring process will be conducted for the number of bread bundles baked, the weight of bread bundles, the quality of the bread bundles through three levels (the first one in the bakery by the bakery officer, the project officer, and the project assistant and through the volunteers in each distribution point daily, an external monitor from each camp will attend the distribution process, and s/he will monitor the quality and quantity of the bread distributed. Each level of the monitoring process, including the external monitor, will be reported daily, contained signed papers, and reported to the Turkey-based project manager to match all it together. 
A card with a serial number that matches with the SKT database received by hand with the same beneficiary will be distributed for each family monthly.

COVID-19 prevention measures recommended by the FSL cluster will be taken into consideration while implementing the project activities. 

SKT has developed an integrated MEAL and Risk Management plans. PSEA reporting and BNF feedback system are active and functional.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Food Security and Emergency Nutrition response to the most vulnerable conflict-affected IDPs in Al Bab, Aghtrin, Jarablus and Ghandorah sub-districts</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is supporting the food security intervention through distribution of free bread to the IDPs HH in Al-Bab, Aghtrin, Jarablus, and Ghandorah sub-districts, with Nutrition-sensitive response to enhance the food security and nutrition.
The project aims to support 8,524 IDP households (42,924 individuals: 8,256 men, 9,399 women, 13,279 boys, 11,990 girls) in 18 camps in Al-Bab, Aghtrin, Jarablus and Ghandorah sub-districts in Aleppo governorate with free bread distribution in an average of 1 bundle with 800-gram weight for families with 5 members and fewer and 2 bundles with 800-gram weight for families with more than 5 members per day for continuous 140 days over 5.5 months.
To achieve that, BINAA will contract with 4 bakeries from the surrounded area and will provide them with wheat flour and operational costs to prepare the daily needed quantities of bread in order to be distributed to the targeted camps over 27 distribution points.
The distribution will be under the supervision of BINAA field staff (Males and females) and support from the representatives from the local communities.
The project was designed as a continuation to provide free bread distribution to the targeted families who were receiving support through a previous project funded by OCHA until the beginning of April 2021. this was according to the analyses of the needs&#x2019; assessment and FGDs conducted by Binaa which shows the continuity of the need. (refer to Attachment 01-02-04).
BINAA field team will conduct verification visits to 100% of the 18 camp&apos;s residents to add the new arrivals and exclude who left the camps, and this verification will be conducted on monthly basis to ensure the exact number of families and provide them with the assistance.
Binaa will start early procurement in order to fill the gap of stop provision of assistance early in the project period, so Binaa can start the bread provision on time, however, the all the contracting will be after signing the agreement.
BINAA will conduct awareness campaign on the best practices towards COVID-19, mechanisms for reporting violations (GBV and SEA), and access to service, health, nutrition and protection centers.
the campaign will conduct through expert team from the protection staff, (majority of the staff will be women) to cover youth, women, elderly and PWD.
Through the project Binaa will formulate 8 Nutrition Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) to support 46 location in Al-Bab, Jarablus, and Ghandorah Sub-District (Attachment 27), whilst BINAA is already operating 1 RRT in Aghtirin Sub-District since February 2021 supported by UNICEF to the end of December 2021. Hence, the maximized impact of Nutrition Activities with the FSL interventions will be expanded to reach 11 camps in Aghtrin during the project.
The RRTs will reach 13,506 families of the newly IDPs.
The RRTs will Provide the Nutrition Services of integrated CMAM, IYCF, IMCI with adaptations COVID-19 to reach 5,363 PLWs, and 14,392 CU5.
In addition to supporting the engagement of 18% of the targeted families in the FSL program at the food distribution points with scaled-up IYCF-E, WaSH, and Health integrated awareness-raising sessions (1070 families/5280 individuals).
BINAA field team will take all preventing precautions from COVID-19 during the implementation as per the recommendation of Nutrition Cluster, UNICEF, COVID-19 Taskforce, and WHO
Monitoring and Evaluation activities will be conducted throughout the project which will include: Distribution Monitoring, Verification visits, and PDM.
5 camps out of the 18 were not coded by CCCM cluster, so we started the registration process, and the related email is attached, attachment 05.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cash Based Emergency Assistance and Livelihoods in Afrin and A&#x2019;zaz</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The  main goal of the proposed project is to deliver immediate humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable IDP people in camps and member of host communities (HC) in Afrin complemented with a livelihoods activity to improve the resilience of 50 households through small grants. It addresses the overarching aim &#x201C;to ensure effective use of SCHF resources and inherent added value to achieve maximum impact through provision of humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people, while ensuring cost efficiency and closer integration of interventions.&#x201D; Therefore, WHH chose the most cost efficient modalities, to reach as many people as possible. The project is in line with the strategic objectives ASO 2 &#x201C;Life-saving humanitarian assistance and protection to the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on underserved areas with high severity of needs.&#x201D; and ASO3: &#x201C;Enhance resilience of affected communities through provision of livelihood opportunities.&#x201D; The project addresses the clusters FSL, WASH and Early Recovery in target areas Afrin (FSL, WASH, ER) and A&#x2019;zaz (A&#x2019;zaz) und the locations Bablit, Baee, Jandairis, Kawkabeh, Sharan, Suran, and Zahrat Elhayat. 
The project intends to integrate livelihood, food security and wash using cash as a modality. In North-West Syria (NWS), the price of basic food commodities remains volatile and is subject to speculation. Disruptive events, specifically displacement and COVID-19 have harmful and immediate consequences on the households&#x2019; economy and may result in reduced consumption and exclusion, requiring the adoption of a framework of priorities and actions that are focused on livelihoods. Proposed intervention has 2 components:(1) distribution of cash to internally displaced persons(IDPs) in camps and vulnerable HC members to cover their urgent lifesaving needs (2) Small grants for 50 women to improve their resilience towards external shocks through a sustainable livelihood. 
The primary objective of the activity is to ensure that vulnerable families have access to food and WASH items to fulfill the immediate needs. Cash will be provided through a money transfer agent following procedures agreed in SoPs including C19 preventive measures. Value of cash transfers will be $90 per HH for 8 months, following cluster recommendations. The activity will be implemented in/off camps in Afrin, Jandairis, Sharan sub-districts and Suran Sub-district as well. The activities proposed are aligned with ASO2 (FSL) and ASO3 (WASH) of this standard allocation. 
Complementary to the above proposed component, WHH aims at improving the resilience of 50 women through the provision of small business grants. Each grant will be worth 900 USD and enable the beneficiaries to start her own small business. Potential areas of business are textile, handcrafts, livestock, agriculture, and others. The women will receive a training that educates the beneficiaries in (a) basic profit/loss accounting and (b) marketing. WHH will further assist with market analysis. To avoid that the grant is used for ineligible own-consumption purposes, the grants will be provided in two tranches. After completing the first phase of the activity, the grantees will receive the second tranche. Moreover, the women will be assisted for eight months with cash vouchers in line with the activity introduced above. The activity proposed is aligned with ASO3 (WASH CVA) of this standard allocation. 
The following cluster specific objectives will be addressed: 

ASO 2: FSL: Scale-up efforts to sustain minimum food consumption needs of the most vulnerable IDPs 
ASO 3: 1 ERL: Integrated sectoral response for livelihoods creation 2 WASH: Cash-based programming to enhance access to WASH supplies and services</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shafak is proposing to implement an integrated health and education intervention, that aims at ensuring the continuity of essential health and education services in NWS through promoting equitable access and quality of education and health services for people and school children. An integrated approach will be ensured through linking the targeted beneficiaries from both components for instance, supported children with education will be served and/or referred as necessary to the targeted health facilities, and will be supported with awareness-raising on key health messages including hygiene issues and COVID-19. Furthermore, this action will be complemented with other health, nutrition, education, and protection assistance services provided by Shafak and other actors operating in the same areas. 

The proposed intervention will target 61,303 people (22,164 IDPs, and 39,139 HC) including  11,846 men, 17,577 women, 15,908 boys, 15,972 girls, of them 1,756  people with disabilities. The project will be implemented in the Suran and Aghtrin sub-district of Azaz district in the Aleppo governorate and in Dana, Qourqeena, and Salqin sub-districts in Idleb governorate.

The following services will be provided through this action:

1) Health:

Shafak will continue supporting a comprehensive package of health and outreach services including Primary Health Care (PHC) and community health awareness services in two of the existing facilities, currently supported by GIZ until the end of April 21, in Azaz District. The following facilities will be supported based on Shafak assessment, updated HeRAMS, and recommendation from Aleppo Health Directorate:

Aghtrin PHC center, (HF-Code: B0204077)
Ziadiyah PHC center, (HF-Code: B0204066)

Building on the already established and equipped centers, experienced teams, Shafak will continue providing static health services, outreach, and referrals, focusing on the most vulnerable of women, boys, girls, and PwDs. The services include pediatric, reproductive health (RH), nutrition, management of communicable and non-communicable diseases, providing essential medicines and medical supplies, and will be implemented in line with WHO guidelines (Pillar 9 of COVID 19 Preparedness and Response Plan). 

The health services will target 52,922 people including 11,643 men, 17,465 women, 11,642 boys, and 12,172 girls.

2) Education:

Shafak will provide safe equitable access to 4 non-formal and 12 formal education in Azaz district in the same locations targeted under health intervention, and in Harim district. The main activities are as follows:

1. Non-Formal Education services in four learning centers in Harim district through classroom learning modality (with plan B to resort to distance learning modality, based on developments of COVID 19). These No-formal catch-up classes will run in one cycle in summer to allow the transition to formal education, using the Syrian Interim Government (SIG) curriculum.

2. Formal education services in 12 schools in Harim and Azaz districts at the beginning of the school year 2021/2022 through physical classroom attendance modality. 

3. Psycho-social Support (PSS) sessions for school children using (I-DEAL) curriculum in formal and non-formal settings endorsed by UNICEF and CP sub-cluster. 

4. Establishing Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs).

5. Light maintenance and improvement of learning spaces while considering gender-sensitive and disability-friendly WASH facilities.

6. Teacher&#x2019;s Professional Development delivered to 256 teachers (154 male, 102 female) on EiE, PSEA, and PSS, along with providing monthly incentives to education personnel.

The education activities will target 9,734 crisis-affected children (5,197 boys and 4,537 girls) including CwDs along with 403 education personnel (260 men, 143 women).  

The Integrated approach has been detailed in the Coordination and Complementarity Section due to characters count limit.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting the Provision of Life-Saving and Life-Sustaining Healthcare Services for the Conflict Affected Population in Need Within Harim District.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the SCHF 2021 SA1 allocation- ASO2 objective (To provide Life-saving humanitarian assistance and protection to the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on underserved areas with high severity of needs) and in response to the demonstrated needs and gaps in health service provision for the conflict- affected population within Harim district, Human Appeal Turkey (HAT) proposes to support and sustain the functionality of two healthcare facilities in the district for a duration of 12 months, namely:

 &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; maternity hospital in Sarmada/ Dana sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: G0703086).
 Human Appeal Mobile Clinic in Sarmada IDPs camps/ Dana sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: B0200196).

The above facilities will continue providing primary and secondary healthcare services for around 79,560 people in need within their catchment area as follows:
 RH outpatient consultations in both facilities. 
 Pediatric outpatient consultations in both facilities.
 General medicine outpatient consultations in HAT MC.
 Community health awareness services in both facilities
 Provision of essential medicines in both facilities.
 Referral capacity in both facilities.
 CEmONC services, laboratory services, inpatient healthcare for the women of reproductive age and newborns in Iman hospital.

Also, Iman hospital serves as an operation station for 2 vaccination teams operated by HAT and another 2 teams by ACU. Furthermore, IYCF-E and CMAM services are being provided through the hospital as well.

The proposed facilities are operating in Dana sub-district that is classified by the allocation paper among the areas of highest humanitarian severity scores. Also, and as per the HNAP report, more than 77% of Dana inhabitants are IDPs who in turn are among the most vulnerable individuals that need humanitarian assistance (This is confirmed by the previous caseloads at both facilities as 93% of beneficiaries served through Iman hospital and almost 100% of those served through the mobile clinic were IDPs). Furthermore, the healthcare services planned to be provided at both facilities mainly target women of reproductive age, children under 18 as well as elderly individuals that are all considered among the most vulnerable population groups.

Besides referring to the health cluster/ Turkey hub dashboard health facilities map, and for the purpose of ensuring coordinated and non-duplicating intervention, HAT, during the design phase, was very keen to coordinate and communicate with the partners and coordination bodies relevant to project including the health cluster, Idleb health directorate, SRH TWG, and Sham foundation that is operating a pediatric specialized hospital in Sarmada, the same community where &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital is based.

In addition to the above service package, and to ensure integration of COVID-19 related preparedness and response measure, HAT proposes to maintain the operations at the COVID-19 triage station at Iman hospital for the whole project period. This will help the facility to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission and infection among the staff and the beneficiaries. 

In order to promote the cost efficiency of SCHF matched funds, HAT will provide co-funding of around 175,000 USD to support the provision of all medicines, medical and lab supplies, the majority of project support staff remuneration costs needed for ensuring the smooth implementation of the proposed activities and provision of the planned healthcare services. Accordingly, the cost per medical procedure matched to this application will be around 7.76 USD (Or 9.96 USD considering HA co-funding), where both values are considered to be highly efficient against the average cost of around 10-12 USD across NW- Syria.</narrative>

SEMA-targeted HF will receive support in the form of payment of salaries for HF staff (medical and non-medical), monthly operational costs, professional training and monitoring, provision of pharmaceuticals, and other medical and non-medical commodities (including equipment, medicines, and consumables). SEMA support will ensure the provision and continuation of integrated health, nutrition, and protection package services.
In recognition of the risks and urgent needs associated outbreak of COVID-19 in NW Syria, SEMA will provide coordinated assistance to conflict-affected communities, alongside focusing on infection prevention and control through different measures taken for health staff and patients in the health facilities. Triage spaces are already established in front of the identified health facilities. Trained staff will screen persons for COVID-19 and detect and refer suspected COVID-19 cases according to the WHO and Taskforce guidelines. Moreover, awareness raising messages will be distributed to the patients and care givers to ensure risk communication and community engagement. 
SEMA will collect health data from the HFs monthly and share it accordingly. All SEMA - targeted HFs are part of the EWARN network and report weekly bulletin to EWARN regularly. 
SEMA will provide the capacity building, and ongoing medical supervision to ensure the target HFs are staffed with qualified medical personnel and enhance compliance with standard treatment protocols.

Enhance participation of the persons with disabilities through the community inclusion networks and promotion of disability inclusion approach among non-protection actors/NGOs, such as Education, CCCM, WASH, FSL, ER. In addition to existing 14 community networks for disability inclusion, the project will add one more network, and all of them will further progress towards community-based rehabilitation (CBR) mechanism and act as &#x2018;champions&#x2019; on disability inclusion via
-Engage schools to build disability inclusion capacity at education facilities through peer supports and child resilience activities
-Provide training and awareness sessions on inclusion of people with disabilities in communities
-Identify and refer people with disabilities
-Become an agent of advocacy in their communities for rights of people with disabilities
-Plan and conduct community events of their choices
-Conduct accessibility audits in selected camps/IDP sites/schools
Address barriers to socio-economic opportunities and livelihood through customized supports of their choices for the persons with disabilities with case managements, apprenticeship programme and engagement of the private sector. 
-300 beneficiaries and their families among the most vulnerable households will benefit through case management, protection assistance, referrals, and access to socio-economic activities. 
-Engage the private sector on inclusive employment awareness raising and conduct barrier mapping)
-Apprenticeship will offer training and working experiences with other organization on substituted salary while the beneficiaries can gain competitive working skills and knowledge.Upon the completion of apprenticeship, HIHFAD will promote inclusive employment among other humanitarian agencies, and it will advocate cooperating organisations to retain them.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing lifesaving preventive and curative nutrition services for vulnerable population groups with attention to children and women with special needs in NW Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the demonstrated nutrition needs on the ground, Human Appeal Turkey (HAT) and Social Development International (SDI) proposes to jointly operate 11 nutrition rapid response teams (RRTs) across North West Syria (NWS) targeting the children under 5 (CU5) and pregnant and lactating women (PLWs) among others of the most vulnerable groups within the areas of priority (As per the nutrition cluster and this allocation paper) with essential life-saving curative and preventative nutrition services as follows:

- HAT: Establishment and operation of 4 RRTs in Dana sub-district for a duration of 11 months (Locations are coordinated with the nutrition cluster).

- SDI: Operation of pre-existing 7 RRTs: 2 in Afrin, 1 in Maaret Tamisrin, 3 in dana, and 1 in Salqin sub-districts for a duration of 12 months.

The project will be implemented in 23 communities across 4 sub- districts (Dana, Maaret Tamisrin, Afrin and Salqin) provide nutrition services for 83546 beneficiaries including (19200 Pregnant and lactating women 44800 children under five years and 19546 other caregivers (men and women)) (79918 IDPs and 3628 HCs) (1800 PWDs).

HAT and SDI will collaborate to promote the ultimate utilization of the pre-existing resources and expertise relevant to the intervention including the use of the trained staff at both organizations and the shared usage of the assembly points, warehouses, OTPs as well as the exchange of relevant technical expertise and measures of access and coordination at the field level. It&#x2019;s imperative to mention that both HAT and SDI will make sure that the above will not result in increased costing of the proposed intervention. On the contrary, having such complementarity measures in place will potentially lead to overall cost effectiveness of the project.

The proposed RRTs are planned to function according to the TORs and SOPs adopted by the nutrition cluster, and they will be providing the following nutrition services:

 Screening 44800 children 6-59 months, and 19200 PLWs, referral and follow up who are malnourished.
 Provide emergency IYCF counseling for 7750 caregivers including PLWs.
 Disseminating messages on IYCF-E recommended feeding practices, for 30.000 caregivers including PLWs.

 Screen, referral CU5 and PLWs with dangers signs and Medical problems.
 Support hygiene promotion and rising WASH awareness by providing Key messages to prevent the risk of COVID 19 transmission and other infections.
 Identify visual signs of abuse/violence against childU5/PLWs during Nutrition screening.
 Capacity building of 60 frontline nutrition services providers on IYCF-E and CMAM programs in the context of COVID-19 and provide continuous technical support for human appeal teams to build their capacity and strengthen their experience in nutrition field work.

As a part to COVID 19 response, the partners are going to apply adjustments of the nutrition activities to mitigate the risk of infection while ensuring continuity of life-saving nutrition services, where they are going to integrate key messages on hygiene and COVID-19 symptoms, and (IPC) measures, implement a simplified protocol for the treatment of acute malnutrition, use a separate MUAC tape for each child and PLW, distribute micronutrients for two months in advance if available, screen and refer suspected COVID-19 cases, applying recommended IPC measures, provide IYCF-E counseling, either at the appropriate distance of 1 meters apart or remotely by phone or video and disseminate IYCF-E messages use platforms such as text messages and WhatsApp videos, posters in public places. 
The partners will train the caregivers of MAM and SAM cases on MUAC and edema screening, referral, recognize signs of deterioration, and give them a mobile or WhatsApp number of the CHW to contact in case the child&#x2019;s condition deteriorates.</narrative>
