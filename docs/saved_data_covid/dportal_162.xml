   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increasing self-resilience of the persons with functional difficulties by providing  prosthetics and creating inclusive protective environments through community and beneficiary participation</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will form a complementary part of HIHFAD on-going comprehensive supports to survivors of ERW and other conflict-related and nonrelated injuries  (mobile outreach service, fixed rehabilitation service, prosthetic service, inclusion mainstreaming and peers counselling) with multiple partners. In addition, the project emphasis on participation of the beneficiaries themselves and the community members to harness inclusive and protective environments in the target communities through establishment of community networks on inclusion and case management.

Building on HIHFAD&#x2019;s previous success in harnessing self-reliance and self-confidence among the most marginalized group, the proposed project aims at increasing self-resilience of the persons with disabilities and creating inclusive and protective environments through community and beneficiary participation. 
Through three inter-connected components
1) Benefiting and empowering people with amputations directly through prosthetic supports in Northwest Syria. 
2) Enhancing community-based inclusive approach and protection among the local communities and local NGOs through creating community inclusion networks.
3) Providing customized supports of their choices to the persons with functional disabilities through case managements 

1-Provison of 200 prosthesis in Albab city (8 months)
This project is a co-fund to operate Al Bab Center for additional 8 months between November 2020 and June 2021(the center is funded till Oct 2020 by HALO Trust)During 8 months, the center will install 200 prosthesis.
The beneficiaries will be selected from HIHFAD beneficiary list or through referral channels, after determining their ability to receive a prosthetic limb based on their K-level(a rating system used to indicate a person&apos;s rehabilitation potential).
The selected beneficiaries will undertake required physical rehabilitation at the HIHFAD rehabilitation centre prior to receiving prosthetics.
Transportation will be provided for the beneficiaries in need throughout the whole process.


2- Enhancing community-based inclusive approach (12 months)
The project will target 14 community, 1 inclusion network will be established in each community consisting of people with and without functional difficulties. They will first undertake inclusion training for themselves, and later, they will actively engage in planning and conducting of the following tasks:
- Plan and provide training and awareness sessions on inclusion of people with disabilities. 
- Identify and refer people with disabilities
- Become an agent of advocacy in their communities for rights of people with disabilities
-Plan and conduct community events of their choices.
In addition, the project will conduct evidence-collection activity to compile lessons learned from community-based inclusive approach.
3 - Case Management and Protection Assistance: 
300 beneficiaries and their families among the most vulnerable households will benefit through case management, offering PSS sessions, protection assistance, referrals, specialized service and access to socio-economic activities.
The beneficiaries can request their choices of supports, which will be assessed and verified by the committees (HIHFAD staff and community members). This could include items to immediately reduce constrains faced by the most vulnerable households or more resilience-focused choices such as skill training, livelihood kits accelerated education.  
An average value of 180USD per person will be allocated for multi-purpose assistance through case management.
The coronavirus pandemic expands an existing gap in the provision of this project services.This project was designed taking into consideration the expanded needs.

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WSA runs three WGSSs in Bennish, KafrTakarim, and Kaferlucin in Idleb, NW Syria, and plans to continue implementing activities through providing protection services for women and girls affected by the crisis, including GBV survivors and persons affected by war injuries and mild physical disabilities. These are backed by Casualty Data Collection that is going to be shared with IMSMA and to help in identifying cases and needs for planning. Besides the three mentioned locations, our partner NAS will conduct RE and VDC services in Idlib sub-district. COVID-19 awareness messages -and prevention procedures- will be put into consideration in all activities.
The WGSS in Bennish, provides protection services for WampG, in line with the UNFPA Guidelines, including WampG with a mild physical disability. The center contributes to the promotion of services and measures of MA and quality GBV services providing appropriate services to prevent and reduce the risks of GBV, ERW, and COVID-19 in the mentioned location. The center offers child care to improve access for women with little children, besides an outreach service through trained mobile teams that can reach beneficiaries who cannot come, or have no access, to the center. According to the latest developments regarding the global pandemic of Coronavirus, the WHO guidelines, and following the guidance note on the provision of GBV and MA services during the COVID-19  Pandemic, developed by the GBV and MA SCs WSA has begun to provide the services by reducing the number of beneficiaries inside the centers and increase the outreach activities, taking into account the recommended prevention measures.
In terms of the other two locations (in KafrTakarim and Kaferlucin), MA service will be provided, including RE and VDC, plus referring cases in need of individual assistance. These services are going to be provided through fixed and outreach activities.
Indoor activities:
Train teams on how to prevent COVID-19 and RE communicating messages to beneficiaries (IDPs, host community, and humanitarian actors), casualty surveys, GBV, and RE.

In addition to providing direct support service and referrals to other services according to the referral paths that are shared by the sub-clusters, and service mapping through coordination with actors in the area, continuously updated.
Provide vocational training (sewing) for the most vulnerable WampG.
Case management principles to be followed, privacy, informed, a survivor code. All case-related files are kept confidentially in a locked cabinet and are periodically destroyed after e-copies are held secured, where only the CW and the T-supervisor can reach them.
Preventive activities, such as life skills (My safety my wellbeing) and recreational activities, young mother&#x2019;s club in coordination with SRD and CARE.
Distribution of awareness GBV (GBV-SC package), RE (MASC messages), Covid19 (WHO tools) brochures.
Refer cases/victims in need of individual assistance (VA).
Outreach activities:
 Provide emergency response for WampG: PFA, CM and referral, registration for GBV cases, and VDC for ERW survivors.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing essential general protection and child protection services to conflict-affected girls, women, boys, and men in Idleb, Ariha and Jisr-Ash- Shugur</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Syria Relief SR aims to continue providing General Protection and Child Protection services in south and west Idleb, after starting delivering those services in north Idleb under the 1st RA 2020. The project aims to deliver planned services to most vulnerable Girls, Boys, Women and Men GBWM in Idleb, Ariha and Jisr-Ash- Shugur districts through 4 static community centres CCs within 4 relatively densely populated communities in addition to 4 mobile units.
SR will ensure the services are accessible by PwDs and will consider all possible precautious measures (social distancing and using the PPE) and Cluster guidelines related to adapting Protection services delivery modalities in light with COVID-19, to ensure the safety of staff and beneficiaries and avoid causing harm (see attached SR COVID-19 Response Plan).
The services will be delivered during 12 months starting from 1st of Jul-20, addressing the identified Protection and CP needs of targeted individuals.
 The Overall Project Objective is designed to provide integrated protection and CP services and coordinate closely with local service providers from other sectoral services (FSL amp Early Recovery, WASH, and Health-Nutrition actors) to facilitate access of persons with specific needs to those services. 
The outcome of the proposed intervention will be conflict-affected and most vulnerable GBWM, including PwD, have a better understanding of their rights and better resilience through benefitting from legal Protection, Protection and Child Protection services.
 This Outcome has been informed by the ASOs 1 and 2 as outlined in the 2020 1st Standard Allocation. 
SR aims at the continuation of protection activities within areas of operation. Besides, the protection teams will extend their reach into new subdistricts in Idleb governorate rated 4, 5 or 6/ 6 in the severity scale. 
Protection services are intended to provide a package of essential preventive and responsive services to affected Host communities, IDPs and Returnees through expanding the capacity of mobile outreach teams, reactivating Ariha centre (CFS), and launching new Protection activities in parallel with the existing Education activities that SR implements in Jisr-Ash- Shugur. 
 The project is designed to reactivate Ariha static facility that SR evacuated in Oct-20 and add 1facility in Korin, 1 in Jisr-Ash-Shugur and the fourth facility in Hanbushiyeh. The 4 static facilities will be community hubs through which SR can identify and respond to most affected populations. 4 mobile units will be attached to those centres to reach out PwDs or those practising voluntary quarantine so they cannot visit the centres. The gender-mixed mobile units will also deliver the project services within 8 neighbouring communities.
The proposed CCs and mobile units will provide many general protection and child protection services including awareness-raising about legal protection, general protection and CP concerns. SR Teams will also provide case management and IPA to the identified most vulnerable GWBM. PSS will be delivered to girls and boys. Besides, parents will have the opportunity to join positive parenting skills sessions. Training about HLP/CSD and CP will be delivered to concerned humanitarian workers to ensure they are well capacitated. Community-based Protection committees will be supported. Furthermore, the Protection Teams will be part of the current Cluster taskforces and collect data related to Protection Monitoring and Child Protection Situational Monitoring surveys. Emergency focal points will be assigned to contribute to Cluster efforts in coordinating the Protection response. 
Protection services will provide a secure and supportive environment, building on existing capacities within the local communities and expanding the population of SR response team. SR Protection Teams will implement all Project activities directly with support from SR Turkey Office.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Facilitating access to clean and safe drinking water to conflict-affected communities in Idleb 2020 - 2021</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GOAL proposes to support 16 Water Stations (WSs) managed by 3 Water Units (WUs) in Idleb Governorate to enhance their capacity to meet increased local water demand owing to population displacements, outlined in section 2 of this proposal. The aim of the action is to ensure access to reliable, safe and clean drinking water by conflict-affected communities including host and displaced populations in the northern sub-districts of Idleb Governorate. This will be done through infrastructure rehabilitation and repairs, training and coaching to WUs and subordinated WSs staff, and water quality management. Complementary to this, COVID-19 adapted hygiene promotion sessions and COVID-19 community led action (CLA) sessions will be carried out. The project is a continuation of the ongoing OCHA Syria Cross-border Humanitarian Fund (SCHF) funded project (TUR-19/3559/SA2/WASH/INGO/14498) that is currently due to end on 08 July, and is pending modification request approval for extension until 31 July 2020. 

The proposed action will enable approximately 180,369 people living in the targeted WSs&#x2019; catchment areas to regularly access adequate quantities of clean and safe drinking water, piped directly to households (HHs). Approximately 35 litres/person/day (LPD) will be pumped to HHs. This is in accordance with current WASH Cluster COVID-19 guidance. Additionally, 3,150 people attending GOAL distributions under other projects will be reached with COVID-19 adapted hygiene promotion sessions and 350 individuals will participate in COVID-19 CLA sessions through this action. In total 3,500 people will benefit from hygiene activities.

GOAL&#x2019;s wider WASH programme, including the current active version of the proposed project, has undergone an intensive COVID-19 preparation and adaption process that will enable GOAL to continue providing these essential WASH services in the case of a COVID-19 outbreak.</narrative>

As targeted camps are already supported by Takaful till July, so, the continues of providing services is critical in saving individuals lives, un addition to benefiting from pre-provided supplies. 
The project will achieve its objectives through a combination of two main interventions:
WASH:
-In the first 3 months We will construct collection tanks in the camps and connect it with water sources by establishment a water supply network from the available sources to the high-water tanks in addition to linking it to the sub-tanks via a network within the camp ground for the following camps (bin Al-Yaman, Brdghli.Al-Matar, AlRefatyah) in order to increase sustainability and enviromental preservation, and during this period, we will provide water trucking 40 liter per person per day.
In (Al-Madina, Al-Hamra, Al-Fesal and Al-Ajaj) camps we will provide water trucking due to the inability to connect these camps to water sources for several reasons such as the large distances between camp and the source, necessity of the network passing through private lands or the camp location in high mountainous.
-To enhance the ability of the beneficiaries to hygiene, especially with condition of COVID19, we will distribute two hygiene kits for each family in the 2nd month and in 4th month and the contents will be according to cluster guidelines. Also, hygiene promotion sessions will be conducted in targeted camps, through trained mobile team (M,F) about the hygiene, COVID-19 preventions and IEC , taking into account the prevention procedures, social distancing and sterilization.
-Then we will work on construction of 244 latrines (122 blocks) according to cluster standards related to COVID-19, gender sensitive by building separated blocks, safe accessible, and its doors provided with locks, latrine for PwD with special arrangements, septic tanks will be desludging every 20 days.
During implementation of the project 203 garbage containers will be installed for the waste disposal once each two days for each camp will be implemented.

NFI:
At the beginning of winter, the same beneficiaries will be provided with restricted value E-voucher with total value of $180 which was determined to meet HH&apos;s winterization needs of 360 liter of fuel and a stove &quot;based on SNFI cluster guidance&quot; by dividing this value into three phases, where a specific balance ($60-$60-$60) will be loaded to HH&apos;s voucher at the beginning of each phase. 
1622 HHs will be targeted with various fuel types (Kerosene-Diesel&#x2013; Firewood and Olive pits) and stoves where this diversity will give the opportunities for HH to choose the type of fuel prefer and the related stove from the vendors who prefer, vendors will be selected according to specific criteria.
we will conduct a PDM to ensure that the service arrived to the beneficiaries in a smoothly and to measure beneficiaries satisfactory
In case of displacement during the implementation, priority will be given to newly IDPs, furthermore, if an urgent problem occurs and there is no possibility to distribute in one of targeted location, we will replace the beneficiaries and choose another beneficiary according to criteria in another location in coordination with SNFI Cluster
-Principles of Do No Harm will be applied in all activities through several market visits, distribution monitoring
We will coordinate with NGOs and the clusters to avoid any overlap.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support the people in the north of Syria by providing WASH services</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is designed to respond to the WASH needs of 166592 people (Men: 27765, Women: 28321, Girls: 54975, Boys: 55531),(140876 IDPs and 25716 hosted people) with 1421 people  of them are people with disabilities, to respond to their protracted needs  by ensuring the good access to the  sanitation service 
The men, women, boys, and girls in Dana city are suffering from the poor sanitation infrastructure in the city since the sewage network is covering only 50 &#x2013; 60 % of the city and it was prepared to serve this small city with a maximum capacity of 16751 people while the  city and due to the ongoing crisis witnessed large displacement waves and the number of IDPs touched more than 140,000 IDPs which consist more than 85 % of the population of Dana 
These terrible figures increased the suffering of the people and the pressure on the already weak  infrastructure and made from Dana city one of the most affected areas of Leishmania in northern Syria according to the information of the EWARN and the statement of the medical centers in the area in addition to the notable flood of the wastewater in the public street in all the seasons and especially in the winter which is damaging any humanitarian efforts to respond to the Leishmania cases since the main cause of the problem will remain, and the treatment solutions are useless as long
The spreading of Leishmania  is not caused by the poor sewage infrastructure only but also it is by the inability of the local council to put well solid waste management in place and this is another factor can increase the threat on the vulnerable people 
SECD is aiming to solve this long-known problem in the city by undertaking the rehabilitation of the sewage network in the city and supporting the local council to activate good solid waste management which is protecting the people from the expected flood in winter, reducing and eliminating the Leishmania causes and protecting the groundwater from the pollution which considered the main resource of the drinkable water in the city 
During the project SECD will conduct the following activities:
1-Rehabilitation of the sewer system which includes but not limited to Rehabilitation and extending of Sewer system network (HDPE 30cm diameter ):1770m, - (HDPE 40cm diameter ):1330m,- (HDPE100 cm diameter ):4393m, and Conducting about 70 manholes. 
3- undertake Fast and light rehabilitation of the solid waste landfill.
4-Rehabilitation and or /providing of the solid waste truck.
5-Support SWM unit with salaries and fuel for 5 months, and Uniform for the workers, masks, gloves to protect the workers of coronavirus-2019 with ensuring the application of cost recovery system for this activity in the future to achieve the sustainability in this service with Conducting solid waste campaigns to encourage people to participate in this humanitarian effort 
7-Conducting hygiene promotion campaigns.
8-Distribution of 3000 hygiene kits (two rounds) for new IDPs  which did not receive hygiene kits during the last three months .

SECD will be in close position with the local council,  the beneficiaries, the IDPs and the host community and will involve them in all the project stages from the planning till the closure of the project to adhere to the community engagement approach by inviting them to regular FGDs and open all the channels to receive their feedback, complaints, and opinions.
the proposed project ensure that the sanitation service would be provided to 7 schools, 4 hospitals, 2 children friendly center,2 Women empowerment centers, and 7 public bakeries.
Moreover, 264792 people (188084 IDPs, 76708 Hosted people ) living in (Termanin, Tal Elkaramej, Burdaqly, Sarmada, Hezreh - Hezri, Tilaada, and Dier Hassan) could be considered as indirect beneficiaries since they will benefit from the project because the main outlet sewer of these communities discharged to the main sewer of Dana city which SECD will rehabilitate and replace it</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of sustainable access to clean and safe drinking water for IDPs in Atma camps</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project activities aim to provide life-saving assistance that assures sustainable and safe access of 91,616 IDPs (17,256 Men, 20,464 Women, 28,998 Boys, 24,898 Girls 13742 PwD) living in Atma camps and informal settlements to clean and safe drinking water services through connecting IDP sites to a new installed drinking water system.


Need
------
Currently, drinking water is being supplied to IDPs living in Atma cluster through water tanks distributed withing the camps with limited storage capacity of the HHs living in the camp and informal settlements. The tanks are being filled by water trucking vehicles that transport the water from the nearby boreholes to the tanks. IDPs take their daily share of water from the water manholes next to the tanks and store it in jerrycans or containers. IDPs, especially the most vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly and PwD, face many risks and difficulties while obtaining water. One of the most critical risk is spreading infection with an infectious disease due to crowding at water distribution points, especially with the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition to health risks, there are protection risks that are increased with using water trucking method, especially for women, girls, PwD and children. These developments and causes have created an urgent need to upgrade the water system in IDP sites to provide sustainable solutions that ensure the effective and safe access of IDPs to safe and clean drinking water services.

Intervention
---------------
At the beginning of the project, Bonyan Organization will ensure the community engagement through discussion with main stakeholders -including all types of beneficiaries, key informants, and local authorities- to identify locations of water distribution points with considering the initial drawings of the water network. Then Bonyan will develop and sign MoUs with main stakeholders, including 1) Local Authorities, and 2) Humanitarian actors who work in water trucking services in the targeted camps (mainly Global Communities Organization.
Based on results of community engagement discussions, technical assessment, and topographic survey, Bonyan will develop detailed technical specifications and scope of work to identify the number of water distribution points and their distancing in every sub-pipe. The distribution points will feed safe drinking water pipes that will be connected to all tents/buildings in the targeted locations. Bonyan will carry out installation works, using a contractual method under supervision of Bonyan engineering unit, as listed here:
1) Pumping Station
- A ground water tank, capacity of 300 cubic meter
- 4 centrifugal water pumps, power of 15 HP per each
- Electric generator, power of 75 KVA
- Electrical control panel
- Key facilities of the station
2) Water Network
- Water network (HDPE pipes and shutoff valves)
- Connecting the network to existing nearby boreholes.

Besides that, Bonyan will establish 2 hygiene and awareness promotion teams to conduct and design proper awareness promotion activities that ensure physical distancing, COVID-19 related recommendations, and importance of saving water &#x2026; etc.

At the end, Bonyan will hand over the project to the community that is representative by engineering office of Local Authorities in Atma Cluster, and provide it with engineering layouts/ drawings, technical specification documents, and maintenance/ expansion instructions of the pumping station and water network.

Bonyan will achieve the project objective through a series of specific activities and processes, taking into account accountability to affected-people, protection mainstreaming and GBV/PSEA, risk analysis and mitigation, tight monitoring and evaluation processes, and effective coordination with all stakeholders, as well as, a coherent exit strategy that contributes to sustainable results of the project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Delivery of Essential Life-Saving and Life-Sustaining WASH Services in Areas of Return</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed action will provide life-saving and life-sustaining Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) assistance in Ariha and Atareb sub-districts. Targeted sub-districts are home to approximately half of all conflict affected people who returned during early April and are ranked as highest in terms of WASH severity of need by the 2020 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO). Planned activities have been developed in close coordination with the WASH cluster and other members with COVID-19 prevention measures incorporated across the program design.

The project will benefit a total of 58,450 conflict-affected people, of which 10,450 are Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and 43,500 are host community members in Ariha City and Jeineh Town (Atareb sub-district). All 47,500 beneficiaries targeted in Ariha are recent returnees, with approx. 3,000 of the 10,500 beneficiaries targeted in Jeineh also recently returned following conflict-related displacement 

The action will address critical gaps in access to safe water through rehabilitation works to Jeineh station and essential repairs to Ariha City water stations and existing boreholes completed during the first three months of the action. Provision of operational and maintenance support to water stations will be initiated from July in Ariha and from October in Jeineh (following completion of station rehabilitation works).  Field visits by Big Heart WASH Engineers and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) completed during May have shown that just under half of the Ariha City water network infrastructure was damaged by conflict escalations earlier this year, with replacement pipes required for approximately 15% of the Jeineh network. In response, targeted works to repair sections of the water networks will be completed in both communities during the first three months of the action. Priority will be placed on ensuring schools, health centers and reception centers have adequate access to water during the planning and implementation of water network infrastructure works. This will include the COVID-19 Quarantine Center planned by Violet in Ariha City and the medical points managed by UOSSM and Al AmeenThe creation of tariff systems will be initiated during November with levels of Operation amp Maintenance (OampM) support gradually phased out from February to ensure sustainability and maintain access to affordable safe water beyond the project duration (please see activity 1.1.5 for more detail). 

Sanitation services have been assessed and highly targeted upgrades to rainwater drainage systems will be completed in both communities from September through to November 2020. 

No selection criteria will be applied to planned water and sewage / rainwater drainage activities which will be delivered at community level to ensure all returnees, host and IDPs in targeted areas benefit from increased access to improved WASH services. 

In addition to ensuring access to adequate water and improved rainwater drainage, hygiene promotion and awareness activities will increase understanding of COVID-19 prevention and response measures and promote positive hygiene practices, safe waste management and ways to mitigate risks of waterborne and other diseases (such as Leishmaniosis). These activities will be conducted during the first four months of the action and supported by distribution of essential COVID-19 hygiene materials (soap and cloth detergents) to beneficiaries most vulnerable to the pandemic. 

The action is informed by technical assessments of targeted water and rainwater drainage systems completed by Big Heart Engineers and included under the Documents section of this submission. As such, proposed activities are evidence-based, technically sound and accurately budgeted.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">By the proposed intervention IYD aims to increase access to sustainable water services in three camps in Harbanoush, Maaret Tamsrin sub-district, the project will support the newly displaced IDPs from Maaret Alnuman to Harbansoh Camps with safe, clean and sustainable drinking water through rehabilitation works which they are proposed in this project including the expansion works for the existing water network to reach the camps around the village who are depending on the water trucking to ensure their daily water need, increase the pumping capacity in the village by equipping the drilled well by the local council with electrical and mechanical equipment such as generator, submersible pump and electrical control panel, also the works includes construction work for generator and pumping rooms in addition to high water tank with capacity of 60 m3 to ensure the proper pressure in the network to let the water reach all the targeted camp, and to ensure the sustainability of the system IYD will form water management committee from the camps residents, and train the committee to establish fees collection system, moreover, IYD will cover the daily need of water by provide the IDP&#x2019;s camp residents with daily safe and clean water through water trucking at least 35 liters per person per day of chlorinated water for drinking, cooking and domestic purposes for 3 months, during this period IYD will rehabilitate the water pumping system in the camp which will replace the water trucking method in the targeted camp, once the rehabilitation works completed, IYD will cover the operational cost for five months to the established water station which will support the water committee to register all HHs who will benefit from the services and built the tariff system. 

And to improve the hygienic conditions in the targeted camps, IYD will provide the IDPs site residents with solid waste collection and 200 locally made waste containers, IYD will address the gap in latrines numbers in the targeted camps by building 30 new latrines blocks (two cells), making them gender sensitive. and address the needs of elderly and disabled beneficiaries, also as complementary with the latrines IYD will provide desludging services and distribute hygiene kits to raise the hygiene awareness for the IDPs as well as prevention for COVID-19, The planned intervention will mainstream protection principles throughout the project cycle by considering the different needs of men, women, boys and girls. Construction of the latrines and the distribution of the water tanks will be consulted with women/men and boys/girls to ensure they serve the communities equitably and consider the specific needs of these groups. 

More specifically, the intervention will provide operational cost for two main water stations in Batbu and Kafr Deryan, the operational cost includes (fuel, spare parts, lubricants oil, and water stations and water networks operators&#x2019; salaries) for five months, by this activity IYD will ensure provide at least 40 liters per person a day for more than 65,000 individuals in both locations, and to ensure that all beneficiaries will have access to the water networks IYD will rehabilitate the existing water networks by replacing the damaged parts, installation for mechanical parts such as valves and expansion of new water line for the neighborhoods that not covered by the water network. The chlorination process will be under the full control from the IYD staff as well, daily samples from providing water and from the point of use will be taken to do the tests, and daily visit to the HHs to check the storage tanks and containers and ensure clean, this will be done through the water safety plan by IYD.

Finally, it is important to note that all the staff working on these interventions will be given the needed information of any other services in the area (protection, education, livelihood etc.). They will also be trained on safe identification and referrals.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rehabilitation of WASH infrastructure to ensure IDPs, returnees, and host communities have access to water and sanitation services in northwest Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To improve the living conditions of vulnerable conflict-affected households IDPs, returnees, and host communities, WATAN will implement integrated WASH assistance in western Aleppo governorates. This will ensure that basic needs are addressed at the household level, while also building the capacity of conflict-affected communities to cope with COVID-19. WATAN through this intervention will focus on the urgent needs of 47,833 individuals (11,152 men, 11,534 women, 12,243 boys, and 12,904 girls) (20,534 residents, 12,550 returnees, and 14,749 IDPs) residing in 4 communities (Abin Samaan, Babka, Daret Azza and Kafr Naseh in western Aleppo governorate). The planned intervention will include the following:
Water (Abin Samaan, Babka, and Kafr Naseh):
This project will cover the rehabilitation of 3 water systems to ensure 20,557 individuals (4793 men, 4957 women, 5263 boys, and 5544 girls) are receiving enough and safe water with at least 45 L /capita/day. Following the rehabilitation, WATAN under this grant will support the operation and maintenance (OampM) cost for 5 months with descending coverage as follow (100% for the first month, then 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% by the fifth month)
This methodology will give the space of the newly established cost recovery to contribute to the OampM under the supervision of WATAN field staff. Thus, confirming the functionality of the cost recovery system and ensuring a smooth exit strategy.
Trough the operation and maintenance support, WATAN will pay special attention to the water quality. WATAN will monitor the water quality in two main points, the water source, and the end-use.
As the project targets mainly 4 communities (Abin Samaan, Babka, Kafr Naseh, and Daret Azza), Daret Azza was not supported with water activities since after the coordination with the WASH cluster, it was noticed that SECD is covering the water part in the community. Thus, the intervention in Daret Azza is complimentary with SECD intervention in the area.
Sanitation, sewer network rehabilitation (Daret Azza, Abin Samaan, and Babka):
The project will cover the rehabilitation of three sewer networks in Daret Azza, Abin Samaan, and Babka to ensure 42,831 individuals (9,986 men, 10,328 women, 10,962 boys, and 11,555 girls) have safe access to sanitation infrastructure.
As ACU reported, the number of water-borne disease (WBD)  cases have sharply increased by 1,278 cases in Atareb sub-district (ACU report 18/04/2020 to 09/05/2020), and by 945 cases in Daret Azza (ACU report 18/04/2020 to 09/05/2020). In addition and as ACU reported, Atareb sub-district has faced an incremental increase in the number of leishmaniases cases by 253 cases and by 39 cases in Daret Azza. This intervention will contribute to decreasing the number of WBD as well as the number of leishmaniasis cases in the area of implementation through ensuring safe disposal of the sludge with no drinking water contamination as a result of and not limited to broken and not functioning sewer system.  
Moreover, Kafr Naseh was not supported by the rehabilitation of the sewer system as this activity was conducted earlier by IYD. Thus, the activities in Kafr Naseh are complimentary as a result of coordination with the WASH cluster and IYD on the field.
Hygiene and COVID-19 response (Kafr Naseh, and Babka):
This intervention will pay special attention to the concerns related to COVID-19 outbreak, the response will include the distribution of essential hygiene items (Soap and washing powder) to support 8,074 individuals (1,883 men, 1,947 women, 2,068 boys, and 2,176 girls) for two rounds to tackle hygiene issues and thus contribute hopefully to eliminate the possibility of the outbreak in Jabal Samaan district in Aleppo governorate. Moreover, this project will provision of hygiene promotion sessions which will include messages related to COVID-19 prevention and will be lead by female hygiene promoters where possible and under the supervision of the protection specialist</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustainable water and sanitation infrastructure to support IDPs, host community, and returnees in Aleppo and Idleb governorates.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To improve the living conditions of vulnerable conflict-affected households and emphasize on the prevention measure to COVID 19, Saed Charity in partnership with Minber Alsham are planning to respond to 46,187 (out of which 16,426 Men, 17,519 Female, 6,046 Boys, 6,196 girls, and 412 PwD) IDPs in 20 camps and Kaften community to ensure an improved, sustainable access to WASH services and supplies.
In parallel to the WASH cluster strategy in the allocation paper, the aim is to reduce the huge reliance on the costly non-sustainable direct provision water trucking, desludging, etc. towards a more cost-effective cheaper and more efficient response, this is planned to be achieved through connecting the targeted camps and informal settlement to existing nearby water and sanitation system. Furthermore, through this project, SAED and Minber Alsham are aiming to ensure improved access of host communities and IDPs in Kaften community through rehabilitation and operational support for the water system.
The water system will be operationalized and maintained by both SAED and Minber Alsham for a period of 10 months for camps and five for Kaften.
As the number of IDPs and locations planned are high, SAED and Minber Alsham decided to partner together to ensure a better quality response, output and outcome, relying on the very good WASH knowledge and experience of both agencies taking into account that both SAED and Minber AlSham implemented a successful project together and managed to benefit from previous lessons learnt. 
During the design phase of the project, both SAED and Minber AlSham kept in mind any future influx of IDPs into the proposed locations, in a summary, we will be able to respond to any increase in numbers. If any gaps arise, SAED will officially inform the WASH cluster to assist and coordinate with other actors in the field to fill the gaps.
On average 30-35 ltp/d/ will be provided while during Summer season (July, August, and September) as recommended by the WASH Cluster, IDPs will have access up to 40 lt/p/d.

SAED will target 9 camps with a total population of 17,590 IDPs. While Minber AlSham will target 11 camps with a total population of 24,022 through the following activities:
	Rehabilitation and operational cost of four water systems
	Installing and extending water and sanitation network to the camps.
	Constructing high elevated tanks and rely on gravity distribution to the water points inside camps.
	Connecting existing sanitation facilities to installed water networks.
	Hygiene promotion campaigns (following COVID 19 WASH and health clusters recommendation including physical distancing through a mass media campaigns, street panels, WhatsApp sharing methods, etc. will be installed and shared in the premises of the camps as well as the community.
	Distribution of soap and cloth detergents

15 camps out of the 20 targeted already include an agency who are providing some activities. Therefore, this project proposal does not include a comprehensive package as some activities are covered by other agencies. All activities have been coordinated with present agencies to ensure complementarity and avoid overlaps.

In addition, Minber AlSham will target Kaften community (4,575 people) with rehabilitation and maintenance of the water station and water network in addition to degraded operational cost for 5 months in order to implement a proper cost recovery and tariff system. (Minber AlSham will work closely with the local council and beneficiaries to include them in the design and planning phase of set up. In addition, proper capacity building will take place for stakeholders involved in the tariff system to ensure better managing of resources and water system.</narrative>

The negative impact of the pandemic is amplified in areas of large gatherings such as camps, informal settlements, and schools where the ability to apply social distancing rules is severely limited and high level of vulnerability prevents households from investing in precautionary measures such as increasing the use of hygiene items/facilities and Personal Protection Equipment (PPE).

Therefore, PIN plans through the proposed project to cover up to 10 camps with a package of assistance that is aimed at responding to the education needs of said camps in a qualitative and safe manner. In brief, PIN proposes the provision of a blended online and physical education to 2,600 school-aged children in 10 IDP camps, to adequately respond to the COVID-19 created needs with a tailor-made approach. PIN will take on providing students and teachers with the essential teaching and learning materials as well as recreational materials. PIN will cover the learning centers operational costs, including COVID-19 prevention materials, and fuel for heating during the winter months in order to keep learning centers well-functioning and to create a safe and child-friendly environment. PSS will be a fundamental part of the project aiming to improve the well-being and learning capacity of children and teachers, who are not only traumatized by the war, but experiencing many new stress factors and serious impact of the virus. All these services will be provided through the blended approach that combines cautious physical attendance with the distance learning module that PIN has already established across its education portfolio, and allows a prompt shift between the methodologies when needed, adapting to the context.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting the underserved communities in rural Idleb by life-saving aids and COVID-19 preventive masks.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project endeavors to implement integrated activities between FSL and ERL clusters in the humanitarian field in western rural of Idleb province in Jisr-Ash-Shugur district in Janudiyeh sub-district which is considered as high-needs and underserved areas, for both host community and IDP. This intervention will support 340 IDP households in the camps with live-saving food baskets to enhance their food security which will strengthen their immunity during the outbreak of COVID-19 as well. Also, the project will contribute to develop the household&#x2019;s livelihood through establishing sewing workshop as CFW activity for 20 women from host community and IDPs to fabricate 149500 masks wherein wearing mask is an essential preventive measure to break the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic nowadays for specific where the daily statistics from NW Syria about the numbers of people contracted with COVID-19 do not bode well, as the numbers are increasing at an alarming rate that threatens the entire society, which already suffers from poverty and neglection.
The proposed location is ranked as high priority for both COVID-19 outbreak and food security coverage for PIN wherein the HNO severity in this location is 4 out of 5.
The project includes:
I-Distribution of food basket for 340 IDP-households in the camps for eight consecutive rounds where the food basket will cover 100% of the household needs for food in order to achieve their nutrition status and healthy conditions, especially for children, women, pregnant, elderly during winter season and the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. The food basket&#x2019;s weight is 78.3 kg and it will provide the households members with 2100 Kcal/person/day which is equal to 100% per day as per Sphere standards. The FSL cluster recommendation was taken into account in the food basket design and determined food basket distribution modality because the markets in this area consider non-functional. We added 4 boxes of soap to the food basket as a protective measure against COVID 19.
II-CFW activity for 20 women form the most vulnerable households from both host community and IDPs by daily 5 working hours and daily wage 5 $ according to the CWG, by establishing sewing workshop for fabricating 149500 fabric re-usable masks according to the Public advisory on the use of fabric facemasks in the context of COVID-19 with low cost , and distributing the produced masks (4 masks for each beneficiary), according to the COVID-19 task force recommendation to, camps and host community. There will be 2 sizes of the produced masks, one suitable for adults 18 and above and other suitable for children 2 to 18 years old.
This project will support 37375 beneficiaries affected by the Syrian crisis (8016 men, 8429 women, 10203 boys and 10727 girls divided as the following 11755 HCs, 25480 IDPs and 140 returnees) by promoting their accessibility to the humanitarian assistance significantly.
All the people in the target locations and markets will benefit directly/indirectly from the project where the purchasing of the needed materials of both activities will be form the local markets. 
The project is designed with consideration to the clusters and WHO recommendation on prevention and mitigation measures related to COVID-19 especially during the distribution of support. Also,protection cluster recommendations were taken into consideration, wherein all the population in the targeted locations will benefit from the awareness session of MASRRAT protection team in terms of GBV referral cases, early marriage and child labor risks awareness raising sessions. 
The target locations:
- Janudiyeh village 9055 HCs and 7167 IDPs

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated emergency livelihood and SNFI support to vulnerable populations affected by COVID-19 and harsh winter conditions in NWS</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the increasing rise of COVID-19 cases in Northwest Syria and the upcoming harsh winter season as well as persistent violence and a weak economic system, vulnerable people in Dana, Idleb and Atareb subdistricts face significant livelihood challenges and the inability to access critical shelter and non-food items. IDP, host community and returnee populations chronically lack the ability to access livelihood opportunities and the existing manufacturing industries remained strained as a result of the compounding factors. Meanwhile, portions of the population in Dana and Atareb do not have the capacity to work also do not have access to critical household items for the upcoming winter season. This integrated project aims to strengthen the livelihoods of vulnerable people in these sub-districts to produce fabric reusable masks while also supporting people who do not have the ability to work but require urgent SNFI goods for the upcoming winter season. 

With the chronic lack of livelihoods and potential impact of COVID-19 as described above, the project aims to: First, scale-up emergency livelihood support focused on mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on the already precarious, pre-existing socio-economic deficits in NWS by providing vocational training and Cash for Work opportunities to 900 individuals in reusable fabric mask production in Dana, Idleb and Atareb subdistricts, and Second, provide business support to 50 new businesses, inactive existing sewing business and women&#x2019;s groups through business/capital grants and workforce support for mask manufacturers to protect livelihood sources in Dana, Idleb and Atareb subdistricts. As a third and complementary aim in relation to emergency SNFI support, the project will target 2600 households in Atareb and Dana subdistricts that do not have the capacity to work and provide them with cash for winter to purchase SNFI materials to mitigate the impact of the harsh winter season. 

This action aims to not only strengthen livelihood opportunities and the local economy but also to produce and distribute 635,000  fabric reusable masks to 158,750  individuals who do not have access to masks. The full suite of activities aims to meet both the acute and long-term needs of the vulnerable communities by providing short-term work opportunities, strengthening businesses, providing cash for winter to purchase SNFI winterization materials to 2600 vulnerable households not capable of working, and distributing critical COVID-19 mitigation materials and sensitization messaging to 158,750 people. 

UNDP is the global lead agency in the area of Early Recovery and Livelihoods Restoration with extensive experience in ERL projects, including inside NWS. UNDP will work in partnership with IYD, a national NGO which has experience in both ERL and SNFI projects. On the whole, UNDP will be responsible for overall management of the project and its oversight against programmatic and fiduciary risks through efficient contractual arrangements and administrative support. This will ensure timely implementation of the project, the high quality of activities and the program deliverables. Moreover, UNDP&#x2019;s early recovery and livelihoods team will provide technical guidance and expertise to ensure the quality and appropriateness of livelihood activities, the sustainability of the business support which will improve the effectiveness of the project and better outcomes for beneficiaries. The added value of IYD is anchored to their experience in both ERL and emergency SNFI activities in Idleb and Aleppo governorates, including previous livelihood support and winterization SNFI projects. The complementary partnership between UNDP and IYD will ensure the success of the project and that the needs of beneficiaries are addressed.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project targets 7 camps in communities in Dana sub-districts in four communities, most of these camps were established after the last displacement waves between Jan and March 2020, 3 camps are registered in CCCM and the other 4 are not, so GAN will register them as soon as possible, 
The project target 1102 families with cash for food, the cash intervention is feasible in these camps as they all have access to different main markets in the targeted communities, four rounds of cash for food will be distributed in Jan, Feb Mar and Apr 2021, each round consists of 2 weeks for distribution and 2 weeks for validation and PDM, 50$ will be allocated for each family as recommended by cluster and CWG, GAN conducted a deep coordination with different partners working in the same area as detailed in the coordination section, although the data gained form the FSL cluster indicate to more than 90% respond in Dana but no partner plan to target the same vulnerable and underserved camps, the camps were targeted by GAN bread campaign in Aug and Sep 2020, according to the interviews and assessment, 99% said that the first priority is food, the proposed modality is a cash for food, as it is considered one of the most effective modality since the markets are available near camps,
GAN will also train 15 committees in 6 out of 7 targeted camps and equip them with the needed tools for fire extinguishing, FAKs, and other flood tools, and the rest camp will be targeted by point organization as we coordinate with them.
GAN developed a detailed awareness plan includes Key messages about COVID-19 for parents, children, coping with stress during COVID-19, dealing with children and adults, PESA, GBV, and PSS, the awareness will be conducted online through WhatsApp
Monthly market assessment in terms of availability of the items, prices, and accessibility will be conducted to ensure the local markets are functioning and all beneficiaries have good and equal accessibility to the different goods.
GAN will contract with a money transfer agent after assessing the markets and the vendors&apos; capacities in the local markets. where the identified vendors will be responsible for delivering the cash amount to the beneficiaries in the different locations and the payment for the agent will be conducted after finalizing the distribution of each few days which reduces the security risk in delivering the cash in such a complex context.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency food assistance for vulnerable populations in Dana subdistrict.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the increasing rise of COVID-19 cases in northwest Syria as well as persistent violence and a weak economic system. Vulnerable people in Dana subdistrict face significant food challenges and the inability to access critical fresh food items. IDP, host community and returnee populations chronically lack the ability to access food, and COVID-19 items. Inflation has taken a serious toll on the prices of basic goods. IYD, therefore, proposes this response. This project will involve the provision of food assistance to 2,000 HHs

IYD, throughout this proposed project, is looking forward to meeting the food needs where many vulnerable families are either receiving inadequate food assistance or not receiving at all thus, IYD will implement the following activities:
-Provide 1,000 HHs (2,250 males, 2,750 females, and 250 PWDs) living in Sarmada camps (Kamora Sarmada, Um Near, Bsakala, Salah Aldeen, and Dia&apos;a 9 Kafroma ) with cash for food of  $ 50 value on a monthly basis for 6 rounds to buy fresh food at the markets to prevent/reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure. This activity will complement IYD&#x2019;s ongoing project with WFP and will target the displaced people in Sarmada clusters who are not covered by WFP project. Building on IYD&apos;s current project with SCHF under number 15,000, this project will target the same locations and caseload to improve and sustain access to food for those most in need. In terms of market availability and accessibility, IYD has conducted a marketplace assessment to ensure that target populations are able to access the markets near them. Please see the attached marketplace assessments (vendors and buyers).
- Distribute 1,000 ready-to-eat food rations (out of the targeted camps mentioned above) to COVID patients, and people who have had contact with COVID patients and must apply home quarantine. Through this activity, IYD will secure sufficient food items and encourage people who may transmit the infection to apply home quarantine, and thereby, contributing to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in NWS.


Since the allocation paper encourages partners to prepare effective budgets, IYD decided to utilize its own resources to decrease the implementation cost, thus maximize the benefit earned per beneficiary.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the proposed project is to deliver immediate support to respond to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in A&apos;zaz.The activities will be complementary to an on-going Covid-19 related project in A&apos;zaz under German Federal Foreign Office (GFFO) funding and is based on OPS project HSYR20-FSCSHLWSH.-165380-1.The project intends to integrate livelihood,food security and wash using a cash based modality.In North-West Syria NWS), the price of basic foods remains extremely volatile and is subject to speculation.Disruptive events, specifically displacement and COVID-19 have harmful and immediate consequences on the households&#x2019; economy and may result in reduced consumption and exclusion, requiring the adoption of a framework of priorities and actions that are focused on livelihoods. Proposed intervention has 2components:(1)distribution of cash to internally displaced persons(IDPs) in camps to cover their urgent lifesaving needs 2)Cash for Work(CfW)activities to respond C19 pandemic with a prevention intervention where women are provided with necessary tools/resources to produce fabric masks which will be distributed in schools,camps,facilities.1st component of project aims at covering needs of IDPs in camps in areas of food security and hygiene (multi-sectoral) through cash distribution to support HHs especially in winter as there are less opportunities for livelihood sources due to lack of availability of daily worksamp C19&#x2019;s impact on market. Primary objective of the project is to ensure that displaced families are assisted and provided with means for a dignified life until they have access to durable solutions.Grant will be provided via a money transfer agent following procedures agreed in SoPsincludes C19 measurements.Value of cash transfers will be $90 per HH for 5months,amount of voucher will be same with current WHH project to avoid tension between organizationamptargeted people.As ongoing project already covered for 3months,suggested project will be covering rest of 5months to be compatible with FSL cluster recommendation.There will be verification process for BNFsactivity will take place in Sijjo Okul (125 HHs), Sijjo Shuhada(154 HHs) and Sijjo Sifira(61 HHs)camps(Total number is 340 HHs).The second component is the production of facemasks through CfW.The benefits of wearing facemasks by the public in general in order to reduce the virus spread in communities is clear especially in locations where high-density gatherings cannot easily be prevented due to living conditions, and which are considered as a high risk area for the rapid spread of infection. Due to the lack of availability of medical masks and the necessity of prioritizing them for healthcare workers, reusable fabric facemasks are recommended. The fabric facemask will have three layers: an inner layer made from a 600 thread per inch (600 TPI) white cotton, a middle layer made from a high-thread-per inch (gt80 TPI) blend of 65% cotton and 35% polyester, an outer layer made from a high-thread-per inch (gt80 TPI) colored polyester. 20 women will be selected to produce the face masks, based on willingness to participate in the activity, tailoring skills (knowledge of use of sewing machines). They will receive a training on how to produce/sew fabric masks. Subsequently, WHH will provide each woman with a sewing machine together with the required materials to be used also for the training duration. Women will be producing fabric masks and will package them according to the instructions given during the training. On a weekly basis, they will be asked to produce approximately 3,000 masks which will be collected by WHH field team and distributed in schools, camps and selected facilities. The quality of the masks produced will be checked by the mask production consultant. He/she will provide regular supervision for the production and will report any challenges to the WHH Project Team. Women will be provided 90USD/month for 8 months. 15 PWD will be supported unconditiona</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mitigating COVID-19 outbreak in Northwest Syria by operating 2 CCTCs and ensuring food access for those at risk in camps to both reduce the spread of the virus and the economic&apos;s negative effect on their food security (SO1).</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the Health and FSL multisector project, Violet aims to implement integrated activities that contribute to lifesaving and  NWS&#x2019;s COVID-19 response by 1) isolation of the suspected/tested positive cases, and 2) provision cooked meals in the existing CCTC in Ariha, but also by alleviating the negative socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 by 3) the provision of cash for food. The project is designed with the following activities:

Health: Violet strives to maintain the existing CCTC capacity in Ariha to isolate the COVID-19 cases to slow down the transmission of the virus. Ultimately, the activities aim to reduce the morbidity and mortality among the community members, as well as to protect the health system from a potential collapse that might be caused by the rapid spread of COVID-19. Therefore, Violet is requesting funds to support the CCTC in Ariha for 11 months as funding from previous sources ends by mid-January 2021. This component will be linked to the COVID-19 response activities to maximize the project impact such as the referral system, provision of PSS, and wellbeing activities to the BNFs in the CCTC, outreach, and hygiene promotion, disinfection of the public places, and masks production and distribution. Further, it&apos;s coordinated with Violet&apos;s other projects and acts complementary e.g. through referrals.

Food security: Violet seeks to a) provide cooked meals and fresh vegetables and fruits for the patients admitted in Ariha CCTC based on FSL recommendations of at least 2100 Kcal for a person/per day. Moreover, the cooked meals are designed to include nutritious vitamins through fresh vegetables, fruits, pickles, and fresh yogurt to support the quick recovery of isolated cases.

Food security b) Violet plans to respond with lifesaving activities by providing Cash for food (50 USD per HHs) for the most vulnerable and at-risk HHs for 8 rounds. this intervention will also contribute to the COVID-19 response by reducing the negative socio-economic impact due to the COVID-19 outbreak Moreover, the targeted BNFs will also receive soap kits (750 gram/ HH) to improve their access to Hygiene means according to WASH cluster recommendation. the Target locations are the camps surrounding the proposed CCTC, and other CCTC supported by Violet in Idleb to improve the beneficiaries&apos; food consumption of fresh food and vegetables in the COVID-19 pandemic. The cash distribution modality was selected to provide more flexibility for the BNFs to buy their needs, but also to and provide assistance in a dignified way. Prior to cash distribution, Violet will conduct rapid needs assessments to ensure the beneficiaries&#x2019; accessibility to functioning markets to avoid the potential harm of cash inputs. Moreover, the cash will be distributed in USD to improve the purchasing power of the targeted HHs without being affected by the devaluation of the local currency

The project was designed complementary between both sectors by the provision of cooked meals and fresh vegetables to the admitted patients in the CCTC in Ariha, which will contribute to improving their immunity and quick recovery. But also through cash for food for the most vulnerable groups inhabiting the camps in the CCTC areas to alleviate the negative socioeconomic impacts due to COVID-19 and also improve their nutrition status when at risk of contracting COVID-19. 

During all project phases, Violet will ensure the field teams apply COVID-19 preventive measures according to Violet&#x2019;s SOPs. This includes applying social distancing, regular sanitization of the CCTC, and wearing face masks. Moreover, Violet ensures the preventive measures during distribution by minimizing the number of cash beneficiaries in each distribution round, carry out the cash distribution in the well-ventilated areas, as well as supplying the distribution points with sufficient hand sanitizers and cleaning materials.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Continuous Support for COVID-19 Community Treatment Centers CCTCs (SDH Centers)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SDH&apos;s strategy is to reinforce the continued support of the CCTCs to ensure adequate intervention for providing health services for the new suspected/probable/confirmed cases.
Through this call opportunity, SDH is advocating to ensure the continuity of the ongoing intervention funded by SCHF in (CCTC_5 &quot;Al-Seeraj Center in Hazano&quot; amp CCTC_7 &quot;Al-Seeraj Center in Daret Azza&quot;) which is ended by 14/11/2020. in addition adding another center (CCTC_3 &quot; Al-Seeraj Center in Atareb&quot;) for supporting as high priority location. where the Covid-19 outbreak Disease, is still affecting all the world, including the NWS, there is a high need for humanitarian relief, considering the health system in NWS is still fragile with an urgent need for continuous support and increases the capacity of the response to contain the sharp increase of infected cases.
Currently, SHD&#x2019;s through SCHF support is running two CCTCs located in Hazano amp Daret Ezza communities. Each CCTC will be run by 8 health professional staff (out of 32) to provide medical assessment, monitoring, and supportive therapy for the confirmed COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms and without underlying chronic condition (lung, heart, renal failure, or an immunocompromising condition. The CCTC aims to reduce the burden of the caseload at the overwhelming hospital care services and provide immediate support for the suspected cases referred to the centers including testing and diagnosis while providing supportive therapy for confirmed COVID-19 patients. Moreover, CCTCs will offer separate accommodation and restrict the movement of the suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases and providing PSS services as well. The CCTCs will be led by the Health Program management as it&apos;s already a focal point for continuous coordination with HC amp COVID-19 TF, at field level by already trained amp working healthcare workers and IPC workers and other support staff.
These CCTCs are already equipped with all needed equipment to be fully functional, while SDH with this fund opportunity will support the running cost of 3 CCTCs for eight months as the second stage of the COVID-19 response plan which includes 5 fully functional CCTCs in 2021.
the modality intervention will depend on the developed COVID-19 Taskforce operational guideline with 50-bed capacity per-center and distributed as follows:
1. observation areas with a capacity of 10 beds defined for highly suspected cases/contact developed symptoms and undergoing laboratory confirmation testing.
2. Isolation and case management areas with a capacity of 40 beds, run by medical staff to provide medical supportive therapy for confirming COVID-19 infection.
this proposal aims to cover all the approximately 480,000 population of the Aleppo amp Idlib targeted areas, by improving access to community isolation services for the most vulnerable group as following: (1) children lt18, (2) the elderly, (3) women of reproductive age, (4) IDPs and host communities(5) and people with disabilities, Through our proposed intervention. the estimated direct beneficiaries are 2400 Ind, with the indirect effect of maintaining the health safety of the rest of the targeted populations. 
this intervention of the SDH organization is well designed to fill the gaps in the current healthcare services in the targeted areas, in coordination with local authorities and Idlib amp Aleppo health directorates.
the project has a great advantage as all mentioned CCTCs are already functional, the staff is trained on IPC matter and the supply chain for PPE amp IPC is set with no need for a preparation period for operational processes, contracting, coordination with other partners. as all of these steps have finalized with the full functionality of these CCTCs and with the possibility to extend our current agreement and contracts. Overall the SHD&#x2019;s through this fund will maintain the current operational cost HR, logistics,s and provision of complementary medicines, consumable medical, PPE/IPC supplies.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting three Community-based COVID19 isolation and treatment centre (CCTC)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the start of the COVID19 pandemic, there have been about 50 million confirmed cases worldwide and more than 1.2 million deaths. These numbers have started to surge in many countries of what is called as a second wave. Meanwhile in Syria, the first case of COVID19 in the northwest was reported in July and it had been increasing slightly before it started to surge in mid of September. 

The overall objective of this project is to reduce mortality and morbidity of the affected population, aiming to provide COVID19 primary healthcare service through supporting two existing community-based isolation centres in Maart Tamsrin (CCTC-21) and Salqin (CCTC_24) and establishing one centre in Al-Bab city with an approximate coverage population of 300,000-200,000 inhabitants in each location. 

The three community COVID19 centres (CCTCs) have the capacity to provide medical assessment, monitoring, and support therapy for the confirmed cases with mild symptoms. The CCTC aims to reduce the burden of the caseload at the overwhelmed hospital case and facilitate immediate COVID-19 testing through ACU partner meanwhile the CCTC will continue providing supportive therapy for suspected and confirmed cases admitted in Centre. In addition, these CCTCs play the intermediate role of  \ a stabilization moderate case without medical complication and facilitate referral case required hospitalization, while received stable cases at recovery stage from the hospital ready to be received at CCTC in order to minimize at caseload at the hospital level.  Operationally the CCTC divided into three functioning areas this including: 
-	Observation area defined for highly suspected cases/ contact developed symptoms and undergoing laboratory confirmation test and provision of basic supportive therapy.
-	Isolation and case management area runs by health workers to provide medical assessment and supportive therapy to confirm COVID-19 infected mild cases.
-	Recovery area to accommodate the cases under medical supervision until the COVID-19 laboratory test converted to negative. After that, the final assessment and preparation for discharge will be conducted for the cases. 

The specific objectives for this project are:
-	To reduce the spread of the COVID-19 infection in the area of Maart Tamsrin, Salqin and Al-Baba
-	To manage the suspected COVID-19 patients and provide community-based isolation service for the suspected and the confirmed cases. 
-	To provide medical consultation, oxygen therapy, and drugs for COVID-19 cases.

Main activities: 
-	Procurement and provision of medicines, consumables medical supplies including the personal protective equipment, logistics supplies, cleaning material and stationery, waste management, maintenance, fuel, other supplies essential for the facility to function and provide standard quality health services.
-	Recruitment of the professional management and medical staff required to manage the CCTCs&#x2019; implementation activities (10 medical doctors, 30 nurses, 100+ essential staff support for 3 CCTs) 
-	Establishing one CCTC in Al-Bab including WASH infrastructure and the in-patient wards buildings. while this centre is completed, the staff will be working in a temporary facility rehabbed by WATAN in Al-Bab to be able to start the activities in the first month of the project.
-	Operate the CCTCs (Maart Masrin, Salqin, AlBab) with full services (case management, isolation for the suspected and confirmed cases, oxygen therapy, supportive treatment) This will be under direct supervision, to ensure the quality of the healthcare services based on WHO standard guidelines and treatment protocols.
-	Coordinating with the ACU team to facilitate the sample collection in the centre. 

Name of the facilities and type of support and HeRMS Code:  
-	Maart Tamsrin CCTC. (CCTC-21)
-	Salqin CCTC. (CCTC-24)
-	Al-Baba CCTC. (CCTC-34)</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Scaling-up Preparedness and Response for COVID-19 in Northwest Syria through implementing health services to people in need.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to respond to the most urgent needs identified by the cluster and health directorate, where the targeted intervention is built on the dire need of high severity areas in NWS and will provide life-saving and life-sustaining humanitarian assistance to people in need. The project will apply facility-based approach in providing quality isolation and case management services and will contribute to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and decrease morbidity and mortality through filling critical and life-saving gaps in response to COVID-19 outbreak.
Within the beginning of COVID19 response, SEMA applied to the reserve allocation of SCHF to establish a specialized hospital for case management of moderate and severe cases that could be faced during the pandemic, with complete coordination with Health cluster, COVID19 TF, and case management TWG, thus, Idleb Isolation Hospital (Known as Karlton), a central hospital for COVID19 in NWS, located in Idleb City, which is considered as one of the biggest eight referral facilities for COVID19 in NWS according to Idleb Health Directorate, WHO and COVID19 Taskforce, with the capacity of ( 60 ward beds, 10 ICU beds, 10 Ventilators, Laboratory Dep, X-Ray Dep, 62 employees ) got born out and supported until 15 Jan 2021.
SEMA, under the successful partnership with SCHF, aims to complement and build on the impact and learnt lessons of the current project (the dire need to increase the staff number as the nature of this project differs from other health projects and there was a high pressure and over-load on the staff where SEMA responded to that by hiring additional staff from the private fund) by supporting one of the key isolation hospitals in Idleb governorate which witnesses an explosion in the registered suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases.
The Hospital received up to 10 Nov 2020: 254 COVID-19 patients: 106 Ward men, 34 ICU men, 83 Ward women, 7 ICU women, and it has been reported to the COVID19 TF and Idleb health directorate on daily basis. As NWS is entering to the first peak of the epidemic, the hospital currently is considered as a very crucial facility to be supported, as, since 10/10/2020, the percentage of occupations of ICU beds is not lower than 90%, and the general percentage of occupations is around 83% on average. Under this project, SEMA is planning to increase the capacity of the hospital to cope with the increasing needs by increasing the number of staff and supplying the hospital with 10 ICU beds, 10 CPAP devices, and PT device for ICU patients.
The project also will raise the capacity of staff in dealing with moderate and severe cases, in addition to activating tele&#x2013;medicine through 11 ICU specialists from SEMA advisors around the world, who will follow up the cases periodically.
The hospital is linked to the referral system of the Idleb Health Directorate, where there is constant coordination between health centers and isolation hospitals.
Severe cases, whom could be decided to be in need for isolation hospitals, are accepted according to the vacancy and the case status either in the ward or in the ICU. There are about 45 ambulances distributed over Idleb governorate and its countryside where 10 of these ambulances are equipped with mobile ventilators.
The Health Directorate coordinates admissions among the health facilities, CCTGs and isolation hospitals through WhatsApp groups.
When the patient (tested positive) arrives at the hospital by ambulance s/he enters the triage room and the physician examines and evaluates him and he requests x-rays and medical analysis, and if the case is suspected, a special triage form and an admission file are filled out, vital signs and analysis are recorded in the file, medicine is prescribed, then the patient&apos;s condition is monitored by physicians and nurses until he is discharged from the hospital.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Respond to COVID-19 Pandemic Through Supporting CCTCs</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to support 5 COVID Community Treatment Centers (CCTCs) for 8 months, which are the most effective ones out of the 13 centers currently functional and operated by UOSSM.
These centers provide services for treating mild and moderate cases of COVID-19, as they are considered the largest percentage of confirmed cases, ensuring that only the severe cases in which the morbidity is high reach out to the case management hospitals and ICU. 
The intervention in the project aims to address the gap in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in northwestern Syria (northwest rural Aleppo and Idlib) by supporting CCTCs, where surveys will be conducted for all suspected cases of COVID-19 that meet the criteria for the swab (PCR) to be taken and If it confirmed, mild and moderate cases will be admitted, quarantined and treated ( except that are asymptomatic with suitable home circumstances for quarantines ), thus containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and reducing morbidity and mortality rates.
The project also includes educating patients and teaching them how to use personal protective equipment and training them in practice.
These centers are located in Kafr Karmin, Atma, Sarmada, Armanaz, and Dana, which are in the hot area of OCHA allocation and have a population of (998861 for Dana District), 74430 for Armanaz District, and 176282 for Atarep District).
The WHO indicated on August 14, 2020, that studies are varied about Covid morbidity, In any case, global studies indicate that approximately 20 - 40% of positive cases asymptomatic while, 60 - 80% symptomatic (  5% of them needs ICU, 15% hospitalization, and 80%  CCTCs ).
According to the statistics of the previous 5 CCTCs, length of stay (Los), and the capacity, the number of beneficiaries was calculated at 333 per month for each center (1665 for 5 CCTC centers)The center will be as WHO/HC model that include 4 areas:
1-	Triage (first acceptance area in which application filled and IPC s provided) 
2-	Screening and physical evaluation in which admission, referral or home quarantine decision will take 
3-	Observation and isolation in which admitted cases 
4-	Recovery when patient prepared to discharge.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide seasonal and supplementary NFI assistance and CCCM services for the most vulnerable in North of Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Takaful through this project aims to meet the basic needs of heating items to the most vulnerable in Idleb and Aleppo camps by providing them with seasonal NFIs through restricted e-vouchers for 3 months in addition to establish fire points and raising awareness about the fire hazards, prevention and mitigation procedures in the same camps .
The project will target 3233 HHs 16165 individuals (3718 men 3880 women 4849 boys 3718 girls) as follow:
Azaz 1409 HHs (Alrayan) Camp
Dana 1185 HHs (Al Salam, Al-Ahmad, Abnaa alziara, Al Wdahee, Aldarraj, Maarrat Dibsah) Camps
Atareb 639 HHs (Al Raay, Batebo, Ziytan , Al Tal) Camps
Interventions will target the same beneficiaries as follow: 
NFI
Distributing e-voucher with $150 value to redeem it with heating items for 3 months, where monthly $50 will be loaded.
Firstly, Takaful will conduct meetings with local actors to ensure their participation in the project. 
The fuel vendors will be selected according to certain criteria. As we already work with e-voucher vendors in some of the targeted locations in another project funded by HF , that will support our efficient and fast implementation for this project.
Beneficiaries will be selected among the most vulnerable (male-female).
The voucher distribution will be on pre-identified dates and in safe points with easy access.
Instead of physical training, as a response to Covid, an explanatory video will be prepared and shared with benes, includes how to redeem vouchers, vendors&apos; names and addresses, WtsApp number for complaints, in addition to banners describes the redemption process and vendors&#x2019; information.
After ensuring that the beneficiaries have redeemed their vouchers from the vendors, the value of the items will be paid to the vendors.
For HHs who face difficulties in reaching the markets, we will deliver their vouchers to their locations, and giving them the chance to choose kinds of provided items they prefer and then delivering it to their locations.
We chose the voucher modality as it is easier to use and follow up, and gives the beneficiaries the choice to buy what they want from multiple vendors to avoid the risks of fuel storage, where the beneficiaries will visit the selected vendors shops and choose the heating items they need.
CCCM
We will establish fire response committee (males and females) in the targeted camps in order to mitigate the risks of occurring fire, in addition to best response to fire when it occur. We will provide capacity development to committees and camp management staff to response to fire through the training on using of fire response items. In addition, Takaful team will prepare an awareness video and e-brochures explaining the prevention advices to avoid fire, and how to use fire response items in case fire occurred to raise the awareness of camp residents.
In coordination with camps&#x2019; management and fire response committees in targeted camps, fire points will be putted in suitable locations, where each 140 tents will be provided with fire point includes fire response items
The trained committees will transfer the training to the camps&#x2019; residents. 
We will insist on prevention procedures for COVID-19 before, during and after the distribution, including distancing, procedures of sterilization staff and beneficiaries, awareness posters, crowds management, sterilizing DPs according to WASH amp health cluster&#x2019;s recommendations in addition to allocate an employee to monitor and make sure that all COVID-19 prevention procedures were applied.
We will coordinate with CCCM and NFI clusters and other organizations to avoid any duplication. 
The project will ensure equal access for both genders with priority for women, children headed household, PwD, sick and elderly in addition the project staff female and male members trained on the protection and gander equality</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Scale up of Winterization Response in NW Syria 2020-2021</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">**Mercy-USA for Aid and Development in this project will support internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host community in Afrin, Jandairis, and Dana sub-districts with winterization support in the form of in-kind, eco-friendly biofuel, and stove kits

Total number of beneficiaries who will be targeted 3567 HH - 17880 individuals (Men 3592- Women 3929 Boys 4822- Girls 5537) by using in-kind modality for implementation for the most vulnerable households. Mercy-USA will target each household with in-kind 750 kg of olive pit fuel (250 kg per month) throughout the winter months (December 2020, January 2021 and February 2021). The initial fuel distribution will occur along with the stoves&#x2019; distribution or shortly after distributing the stoves to 100% of the targeted households to ensure all beneficiaries have the appropriate stoves to use olive-pit fuel

The Shelter NFI cluster recommendations at minimum 750kg/ HH/ 3 months, however, based on many PDM conducted by Mercy-USA after each winterization project since 2015. Always the quantity is not enough for beneficiaries given the fact of harsh winter seasons in the last few years in NW Syria, so as lesson learned, we increased the distributed quantity per HH to be total (750 kg/ HH/ 3months)

Mercy-USA will distribute olive-pit fuel to the beneficiaries directly on monthly allotments based on monthly distribution plan by specifying dates for each location.

The implementation plan is the same in Afrin and Jandairis will be the same, however, Considering the beneficiaries are identified and verified in Jandairis, it is assumed distribution can start earlier in Jandairis communities

**Mercy-USA will distribute masks and soap along with stoves and fuel to the same beneficiaries to ensure protective measures against COVID-19 are in place without doing harm. each HH will receive five mask and 700 gram of soap on monthly basis. Soap will be donated by IRC to Mercy-USA in order to be distributed along with fuel as in integrated response and complementarity approach while masks will be purchased by Mercy-USA

**Accountability to Affected population (AAP) will be given high priority in this project by communications and sharing information with beneficiaries during all project phases, as well as using complaints and feedback mechanism which is accessible to all beneficiaries especially the most vulnerable such as persons with disabilities, the elderly, women and girls, thus taking corrective actions based on need.

** Furthermore, MEAL plan will be for all project stages such as verification of vulnerability assessment, distribution monitoring, PDM, with using different MEAL tools.

**Reporting will be on timely basis according to the priority, ex, narrative report will be interim and final, while other reports will be on a weekly basis.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of life-saving winterization support to the IDPs in Al harakat and Aljabal camps in Ghandorah and Jarablus.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Summary:
Through this project, Binaa organization seeks to provide support and to response to 2,199 conflict affected IDP HHs (11,174 individuals) (2,305 women, 1,976 men, 3,183 girls and 3,710 boys) in both Aljabl and Haraqat camps in Jarablus and Gandoura villages throughout providing stoves, and sufficient heating fuel for 3 months as per 4 liters for the day.
through this support Binaa will ensures the integration of the food security response and the winter needs response, while Binaa is already providing bread for the all the families in these camps on daily basis since Oct 2020 and that will extend to March 2020 under one of SCHF ongoing project. 
Each beneficiary household will receive stove and diesel for 3 months based on 4 liter per day, Total 360 liter, the diesel will be packed in jerrycans, (Heaters, Diesel, and jerrycans specifications are attached to the proposal (Attachment T 01)
Binaa will distribute 3 patches of fuel, the first one (120 liters) will be in December 2020 and it will be conjugated with stoves distribution, the second one (120 liters) will be in January 2021, and third one (120 liters) will be in February 2021, according to the time plan of the project (Attachment A 01).
The distribution will be in kind at the main distribution points and the quality of the diesel will be checked before distribution, however, the fuel kits will be delivered to the elderly (over 60 years old), people with special needs, and the people who are unable to reach the distribution point for any reason directly to their house (door to door) that will decrease the risk of COVID 19 on the elderly people.
Verification visits (100% of beneficiaries) will be conducted after each distribution to ensure that the beneficiaries are still available to receive the next batch and ensure that they are using the heaters and fuel.
Binaa will follow the SNFI recommended procedures for the distributing of NFIs during COVID-19 in addition to follow Binaa guidance in this regard (Attachment A 02), the following are some of these procedures:
	Preventive measures will be taken to ensure social separation and availability of enough area, that will reduce the risk of spreading of COVID-19, the plan for the distribution point which will be equipped with cones and plastic chains to regulate the entry and exit process is attached to the proposal (Attachment T 03).
	The team will share the distribution plan with the camp management and will inform the beneficiaries a day before the distribution process, and the beneficiaries will be divided into groups to ensure less gathering of the people, however, cards will be given to each beneficiary with the time and date of receipt.
	Beneficiaries will be advised to leave the distribution location moment they receive assistance, they will not pass through the distribution point more than once.
	Binaa will distribute masks to the beneficiaries HHs (5 for each one) as per SNFI guidance for COVID 19, that will be done with each fuel distribution.
Awareness sessions will come along with verification/distribution activities , these awareness sessions will focus on  2 main topics, 1- the best procedures for dealing with fires, 2- COVID-19 awareness (following proper hygiene practices, Covid-19 spread, pandemic symptoms, and the ways to deal with it in case of getting the disease),  beneficiaries will be provided with the numbers of emergency/actors that can deal with the cases, (the list is attached to the proposal (Attachment A 03)).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated WASH and ERL response to the negative effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on the affected communities in NWS</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our response will focus mainly on two sectors, WASH and ERL where we seek through this integrated response to reduce the risks of the Covid 19 pandemic among the already affected people. Our strategy depends on innovative intervention to confront the economic and social impacts of Covid 19 and limit its spread and its effects on the vulnerable people, where the water, sanitation and hygiene package is designed to limit the spread of the Covid 19 and change the wrong and unhealthy hygienic practices and provide the needed personal items that will protect people and enhance their personal hygiene, while the ERL packages will work to help vulnerable people to overcome the negative economic and social results left by the spread of the Covid 19 beside the Syrian crisis through the provision of short-term labour opportunities to skilled and unskilled workers supporting 180 HHs Who will mainly responsible for producing around 155520 reusable masks through the cash for work that will be implemented.
Silk Road will establish (3 ) workshops equipped with the necessary equipment to produce these masks as well as some women will participate from their homes if any (Women have a Sewing machine), while the organization will secure all other materials needed for the production of the masks. The workshops will be in Batenta, Maaret Elekhwan and Kafr Karmin and the main beneficiaries will be selected from these locations. Silk Road will seek to use existing workshops if any and in case it is not possible then we will go to establish new workshops knowing that this will not cost a lot and will not take a long time as well.
The produced masks beside soap that will be secured by the organization will be packed in boxes or bags and this package will be distributed to the beneficiaries in two ways (The first by the hygiene promoters when they visit the family and the second by the head of the family who can come to the workshop to pick up the package). The sewing machines will be handed over to the number of families after the project ends ( Kind of sustainability of the project under an agreement with women, standers and criteria for selection). Silk Road will select the most vulnerable women (Families with no income generation) in each targeted community and we will prioritize IDPs, women ith disabilities, and women-headed household also we will take into our consideration the size of the family and persons he has the ability to work if any. Silk Road will study each case before producing the final list and we will transparently work with the community. Also, once we select the women, we will sign an agreement with them to ensure the rights of each party.
The approach that we will follow in implementing WASH intervention to achieve the desired goals will be based on providing the needed safe drinking water to people as well as support and manage waste collection systems to maintain a safe and clean environment in addition to distributing hygiene personal supplies (Soap +Masks (4 per person) that helps reduce the spread of the Covid 19 epidemic, in addition to re-usable face masks that we will provide through early recovery activities that we will support. These activities will be accompanied by awareness-raising activities that will be provided by the hygiene promoters who will be assigned in each targeted communities(Two in each one). During this period of support (Operation of the water systems), a cost recovery system will be established to ensure continuous cash flow required for running the systems during and after the project (Only the first two months of the project will be supported 100% while the others will be partly supported), this will involve a study on a suitable tariff rate that takes into account the dwindling financial capacity of the benefiting population and will be based on focus group discussions with a representative group of the community including members of local councils of targeted communities.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In recognition of the risks and urgent needs associated with outbreak of COVID-19 and increasing IDP population in NW Syria, CARE will leverage its technical leadership, operational experience, financial resources to provide coordinated assistance to conflict-affected communities, especially the newly displaced one living in Jarablus district. CARE aims to implement WASH activities to mitigate the risk of COVID-19, including increasing hygiene promotion, mass COVID-19 messaging at camps level, providing an increased amount of required clean water to facilitate handwashing practices. CARE will increase the amount of water to 35 L/person/day, reaching 15,250 beneficiaries. Additionally, CARE will work to encourage and facilitate this practice for targeted people living in camps and in communities and will distribute cleaning/disinfecting materials and soap through awareness-raising and behavior change activities. 

CARE proposes to support 3,050 HHs living in Old and New Zoghara Camps located in Jarablus with WASH services in this project. The camps were built by AFAD in 2017 to host IDPs fleeing conflict areas in NW Syria. Through the funds from the first standard allocation 2020, CARE extended the new camp to host 1,200 HHs in addition to the 1,850 HHs living in the old camp and improved lifesaving conditions by replacing damaged tents with new ones, insulating tents and implementing graveling and ground site preparation in addition to securing safe access to WASH facilities in consideration of COVID-19 precaution measures.

The camps are among locations with high reported cases of COVID-19. 104 cases have been recorded in the camp. CARE in coordination with the stakeholders has completed the establishment and set up process of a quarantine zone at new Zoghra camp. The quarantine zone consists of 50 tents facilitated with NFIs. Public WASH facilities have been prepared with equipment to serve the quarantine area. CARE has ensured that the quarantine zone is isolated from the camp&#x2019;s remaining sectors by selecting the appropriate location and having it separated with a surrounding fence. Local authorities hold responsibility of providing necessary medical equipment and staff.

Access to water is essential for effective handwashing, which is one of the most important measures to prevent COVID-19 infection. CARE will work on securing safe access to adequate drinking water by operating water stations, providing the camp with water (35 L/P/D), provide water storage tanks for IDPs and to reduce crowdedness around current distribution points. CARE will conduct full water quality analyses on water sources in advance. Trucked water will be chlorinated and FRC levels will be checked daily throughout the entire supply chain.

Essential emergency services such as desludging, latrines, soap provision will be provided. To reduce overcrowding, improve hygiene behaviors and increase access to handwashing facilities, CARE will install new shared family latrines where Sphere standards are not met (one toilet for every 20 people), installing door locks for safety and privacy and providing appropriate lighting. CARE will also undertake minor repairs to existing latrines including quick fixes of handwashing facilities in particular and cleaning of latrines, including disinfecting communally used surfaces to mitigate COVID-19 infection risk.

For the prevention and control of infections, CARE will apply intensive hygiene promotion sessions. CARE&#x2019;s hygiene volunteers will be in charge of disinfection measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in camps. Disinfection kits including soap and PPE will be distributed along with one-off hygiene kits to all families in the camp. Volunteers will be assigned to sterilizing latrines, water distribution points and WASH equipment such as water tankers using the provided cleaning materials and disinfectant liquid.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Rapid Response to WASH Gaps to Prevent Suppress and Interrupt Transmission of  COVID-19 in Idleb City.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project addresses the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in densely populated areas of Idleb sub-district ranked as high in severity of WASH needs. The proposed action will contain the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic and decrease morbidity and mortality through providing rapid, life-saving Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services to vulnerable, underserved and at risk communities. 

Planned activities respond directly to gaps in WASH service provision which have been jointly identified with the WASH cluster. These are made further more critical by the high risk of COVID-19 in Idleb sub-district, specifically in the dense, over-populated areas targeted in Idleb City. Informed by Big Hearts operational experience with WASH service provision in Idleb City, complementary to our ongoing interventions and designed in full coordination with other actors, the action will scale up water provision and enable improved COVID-19 prevention and response.  

The project will benefit a total of 60,500 conflict affected people living in the Al Gazl station and Street 30 borehole catchment areas of Idleb City. Of these, 28,030 direct beneficiaries are Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), 30,854 are female and 33,274 are children. 

The action will prevent, suppress and interrupt transmission of COVID-19 through increasing and safeguarding access to safe water in areas with identified gaps. Provision of operational and maintenance support to the Street 30 borehole will begin in Dec 2020, meeting the gap in service provision since Big Hearts previous SCHF-funded support to Street 30 ended in Sept 2020. Complementing ongoing SDC-funded assistance, the project will maintain vital operational and maintenance support to the Al Gazl station from February 2021 when SDC funding will close. In coordination with SEMA, WASH services will be improved in two, existing COVID-19 quarantine centers located in the Al Gazl catchment area through connecting these to the primary water network. 

In addition to ensuring access to safe water and informed by Big Hearts participation in established COVID-19 coordination structures, Risk Communication and Community Education (RCCE) activities will be delivered across targeted communities in close coordination with UNDR and Violet. This will include highly targeted distribution of hygiene and sanitation materials (soap, detergents and cloth masks) directly benefitting 17,500 people most vulnerable to the pandemic. The targeting strategy for this component with be informed by close coordination with the COVID-19 Task Force and other members to identify areas with higher C-19 case numbers and areas with dense / inadequate shelter. Vulnerability targeting will then identify households most at risk amp least able to practice positive prevention practices. 

A people-centered approach lies at the heart of the intervention. Programme design reflects the needs, priorities and preferences of beneficiaries identified through monitoring and evaluation of Big Hearts WASH assistance in Idleb City since October 2019. Design of the action also addresses feedback and recommendations from Third Party Monitoring (TPM) of Big Hearts SCHF-funded WASH programming in Idleb City. Specifically, recommendations made to the WASH cluster to assess the possibility of continuing projects to close the water supply gap in Idleb City and increase the number of water tanks distributed. Recommendations regarding gender segregated hygiene promotion activities have already been implemented across Big Hearts WASH programme and will apply to this action, while beneficiary feedback on means to further enhance accountability will also be progressed. 

The action is informed by recent technical assessments of targeted water systems completed by Big Heart WASH staff (included under documents) and significant operational experience with both water systems. As such, proposed activities are evidence-based, technically sound and accurately budgeted.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will support cross-border operations from Turkey into Syria to tap into sources of information and share it for use by the humanitarian community through a team of humanitarian field officers in NSAG-controlled areas. The team will be managed by the HFOs management team based in Gaziantep, Turkey in consultation with OCHA Turkey. The project is designed to broadly support the formal coordination system, especially the clusters/ICCG, as It is based on four pillars.

1-Information gathering
This pillar focuses on gathering data from the ground to produce reports about the humanitarian situation and context and inform response and advocacy. The data is shared with the OCHA coordination unit for use in various platforms and products. Info on unmet needs, including urgent cases, will be shared with clusters to address
2-Support to monitoring of SCHF funded projects.
The HFOs will monitor projects funded by the SCHF. These monitoring missions will be conducted upon the request of the SCHF and based on SCHF monitoring criteria. Monitoring of SCHF projects directly improves the quality and accountability of the inter-cluster response, as projects funded by the SCHF are reviewed through the clusters. The HFAs will also receive a training on MampE tools and methods to ensure accurate and relevant information are gathered by them.

3-Community Engagement
The HFOs will conduct community engagement to strengthen humanitarian response through facilitating meetings with the affected community and the humanitarian community and other stakeholders obtaining feedback from the community on their needs and the response and providing information to affected people through awareness sessions and other means on the humanitarian response and the community&#x2019;s rights and role in it. Community engagement informs the overall inter-cluster response and in some cases is organized on behalf of clusters.

4-Service Mapping
The existing service map app for mobile phones will get an upgrade to ensure ease of use and better accessibility such as &#x201C;text-to-speech&#x201D; for visually impaired people, and more visually-illustrated materials to assist people with reading/writing difficulties. The app will include a virtual information center that will 1)work as an awareness platform disseminating information on key issues such as AAP, COVID-19, and CHS  2)create an accessible repository of information for all affected persons and humanitarian actors to receive support and information to avoid duplication. 

The project builds on the outcomes of a previous project completed earlier in 2021. The information-gathering component is well-established and in recent months the mechanism for sharing specific needs data with clusters was streamlined and has resulted in individual cases receiving assistance. SCHF monitoring activities carried out so far have been well-received, resulting in one of the HFOs becoming largely dedicated to this work and the processes for monitoring becoming more formalized which will be further enhanced. Direct engagement with communities facilitated by the HFOs has allowed senior leadership, including the ERC, to provide high-level advocacy from key constituencies including women and PWDs. The service map app is now available in four languages and hosts over than 2,600 distributed between medical, educational emergency, and other types of services. It is also hosting ads from humanitarian actors, and hundreds of people have registered seeking for training. The app has been well received by people in need, clusters, and other stakeholders. Building on this success, BampZ is planning to conduct a promotion campaign to promote the service map application to ensure it is used by the relevant stakeholders as much as possible. A handover plan will also be set to shift the support of the app to another donor to ensure its sustainability.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting provision of healthcare services through procurement and prepositioning of essential medicine and medical supplies to northwest Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will strengthen access to lifesaving and life-sustaining essential health services within COVID-19 response through procurement of WHO pipeline of PPE supplies to support provision of integrated primary and secondary health care services to the vulnerable population of northwestern Syria. 
The goal of the project is to assist in procurement and preposition of the medical supplies into the warehouse inside NWS from the WHO pipeline (list of supplies is available as Annex 2) available through the Global Supply portal. According to identified needs WHO is planning to organize direct procurement of medical supplies from the Global Market focusing on specialized emergency health kits, including Inter-agency Emergency Health Basic Kits (IEHK), TESK and NCD kits from WHO Global Emergency Stock in Dubai to be distributed among health facilities in Idleb and Aleppo governates. Regarding COVID-19 response in northwestern Syria WHO will procure supplies both for the laboratories aiming to support surveillance system (laboratory Testing Kits, N95 respirators, and Gown) and health facilities providing specializes medical care to COVID-19 patients through intensive care units (ICU) for confirmed COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms and underlying chronic conditions. 

To ensure that these supplies will arrive shortly into NWS, WHO is planning to purchase part of the supplies in Turkey and deliver to Syria immediately since they are under critical demand. Other supplies will be purchased from the available WHO Dubai stock of life-saving supplies and will be based on the existing needs and availability of supplies in Dubai. 

Preposition of the procured medicine and medical supplies would be organized through two warehouses in Syria in Aleppo and Idleb governorates, which are operated by two contracted NGOs which will facilitate the distribution of these supplies to the organizations who are managing the health facilities to receive supplies. These are in-kind donations to the health facilities and WHO will not be having services except for logistics and warehouses. Otherwise, all active health cluster partners have been invited to the WHO supply line forum and may get donated supplies to ones who are prioritized based on the need during the months of distribution. The costs of warehousing and logistics will be covered through other WHO funds and will not be charged to this current project. 

As well it is worth mentioning that considering the risk of non-renewal of the UN Security Council Resolution it is planned to deliver all goods to NWS before July 10, 2021, and ensure health service continuity,</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide life-saving winterization assistance for the most vulnerable  in North West of Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Takaful through this project aims to meet the basic needs to the most vulnerable IDPs in Camps in Idleb and Aleppo with winterization assistance through fuel items distribution by e-vouchers, supporting them with fire mitigation activities as well provide a care and maintenance of infrastructure and facilities in addition to support schools with heaters and fuel for heating in camps.
The project will target 16164 HHs 89110 beneficiaries (16,665 M, 17,380 W, 27890 B, 27175 G) in SNFI and CCCM interventions, in addition to 41788 children (19166 B, 22622 G) in education interventions in Azaz, Idleb and Harim
CCCM and NFI Interventions will target the same beneficiaries as follow: 
NFI - A&apos;zaz 
Distributing e-voucher for 2661 HHs with $150 value to redeem it with heating items for 3 months, where monthly $50 will be loaded.
Firstly, Takaful will conduct meetings with local actors to ensure their participation in the project. 
The fuel vendors will be selected according to certain criteria.
Beneficiaries will be selected among the vulnerable (male-female).
Instead of physical training, as a response to Covid, an explanatory video will be prepared and shared with beneficiaries, includes how to redeem vouchers, vendors&apos; names and addresses, WhatsApp number for complaints, in addition to banners describes the redemption process and vendors&#x2019; information.
After ensuring that the beneficiaries have redeemed their vouchers, the value of the items will be paid to the vendors.
We chose the voucher modality as it is easier to use and follow up, and gives the beneficiaries the choice to buy what they want from multiple vendors to avoid the risks of fuel storage
CCCM - A&apos;zaz and Dana
We will establish fire response committee (males and females) in the 30 targeted camps in order to mitigate the risks of occurring fire, in addition to best response to fire when it occurs. We will provide capacity development to committees and camp management staff to response to fire through the training on using of fire response items. In addition, Takaful team will prepare an awareness video and e-brochures explaining the prevention advices to avoid fire, and how to use fire response items in case fire occurred to raise the awareness of camp residents.
In coordination with camps&#x2019; management and fire response committees in targeted camps, fire points will be putted in suitable locations, where each 250 tents will be provided with fire point includes fire response items. The trained committees will transfer the training to the camps&#x2019; residents.
In addition, 30 team will be established and trained (one in each camp) who will be responsible of conducting camp care and maintenance in supervision of project team and engineers. 
Education:
73 schools, 41788 children (boys and girls) will benefit from the provision of heating items
A tender will be announced through our social media and websites. The criteria for selecting the best vendor will be identified, Selection review committee will select the best vendor and IDs will be used to complete ATC then vendor will sign the contract.
Depending on the accurate need assessment at has been conducted, Schools will be provided with 1055 heaters and 77 fuel tanks.
TAS will provide fuel to 73 schools that include 1644 classrooms according to the plan pre identified and agreed with the organizations (PiN, Saed, ATAA) and schools.
Each classroom will be provided with 3 liters per day for four months (88 working days).

We will insist on prevention procedures for COVID-19, including distancing, procedures of sterilization staff and beneficiaries, awareness posters, crowd&#x2019;s management, sterilizing DPs according to WASH amp health cluster&#x2019;s recommendations in addition to allocate an employee to monitor and make sure that all COVID-19 prevention procedures were applied.
The project will ensure equal access for both genders with priority for women, children headed household, PwD, sick and elderl</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enabling quality learning during the winter period by provision of fuel and heaters for heating to the supported learning spaces.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project supports the winterisation needs of the schools/temporary learning spaces in Idleb and Aleppo, which are supported by Violet and Bonyan under the SCHF 1st Standard Allocation - 2021 as a complementary intervention to the education project that did not include winterisation component in the project design. The winterisation component includes providing heating fuel, stove with accessories, fuel tanks to improve the learning environment in the classrooms/tents to have adequate heating during winter. The project design complies with safe-programming principles for children to ensure that children are safe and protective.  

Violet aims to achieve the overall objective by improving safe and accessible learning spaces during winter in northwest Syria by supporting 76 schools/ temporary learning spaces in 45 location (22 camps), 115 learning spaces (shifts), 947 classroom/education tents with winterization. This includes 3.5 liters of heating fuel for each classroom during 88 days, 441 heaters, 60 fuel tank (2000 liters). The total number of beneficiaries who will benefit from this project: Violet (12772 children, 550 adults) and Bonyan (29402 children, 801 adults), in total, 42,174 children (51% girls), 1351 adults (48% female) 36% of beneficiaries are IDPs through:  
- The distribution of winterization needs (fuel, fuel stoves and accessories, fuel tanks) makes the schools suitable for learning for four months in winter.
- During the preparation stage, Violet will coordinate with Bonyan to develop the distribution plan in two or three rounds includes learning space location, distribution date, round, # of liters, # of stoves, # of tanks, organisation and school focal points contact information. 
- Violet will distribute the fuel in parallel for Bonyan and Violet learning spaces through two distribution teams according to the distribution plan and the amount of fuel needed from October 2021 to February 2022.
- Violet will do the distribution in two or three rounds according to the safety and security team&apos;s recommendations to reduce the amount of fuel in schools to mitigate the risk of stealing and fire (please refer to the risk management section, attached risk assessment and SoPs).
- The MEAL team will monitor the distributions and share their feedback with the program team daily and ensuring that monitoring and evaluation findings and recommendations are taken into account during the distribution process to improve the quality of providing winterization needs.
- Violet will provide PPE kits to the project field staff and the distribution and installation suppliers&apos;  workers from another complementary project. PPE kits include surgical masks, plastic gloves, hand sanitizers to allow the project team applies the preventive measure as per Violet&apos;s SOPs for the distribution in the COVID-19 context.

For the risk management under this project, Please refer risk management section and to the attached risk assessment for the project and safety and security SoPs for Violet operations in the document tab. 

Over the past 8 years, Violet has been working towards building the education system in Northwest Syria by formal and non-formal education in and out of camps with key activities in this project. On a project level, Violet is regularly conducting lessons learned based on the organization&#x2019;s learning policies. Violet maintains good relations with the directorates in Idleb and Aleppo, and with community representatives and other stakeholders. Coordination takes place for high-level topics such as MoUs with the EDs for medium-level coordination, Violet will coordinate with education clusters and the local councils to getting their support in facilitating the implementation of the project activities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Building Resilience to the Vulnerable Crisis-Affected Population in North-West Syria through provision of Education and Agricultural Support.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shafak is proposing to implement an integrated Food Security and Education intervention that aims at addressing identified critical gaps and emergency food and education essential needs in NWS through promoting equitable access and quality of services provided for a total of 56,433people 3,762 men, 3,897 women, 23,608 boys, 25,166 girls, of them 1182 people with disabilities).

1) Food Security:
The proposed project aims to support the wheat crop which is considered as one of the main strategic crops in Syria. This intervention will increase resilience of people in NWS to ongoing shocks of conflict, displacement, environmental changes including drought or the medium-term economic uncertainty overall. Moreover, this action will contribute to food security of the affected populations and increase the availability of wheat flour and encourage farmers to resume or continue wheat crops cultivation. The project focuses on critical analysis of the Wheat Value Chain (WVC), supports livelihoods by increasing households&apos; ability to meet the needs, and encourages self-reliance.

The project will be based in Idleb Governorate Ma&#x2019;aret Tamsrin, Armanaz,and Benesh  subdistricts. The project will achieve its aspired objective by supporting (WVC), in line with the COVID-19 prevention guidelines, through following package of activities:

2350 male and female wheat farmers (owning between 1 to 6 hectares of land each) will receive agricultural inputs and services, extension sessions, harvesting, that covers the cost of cultivating 1 hectare to contribute to decreasing the cost of production the package of support will be:

a. distribution of cash with value (100$/hectare) to support the wheat farmers the voucher will cover the cost of 200kg of seeds 70$ , and 30 $  that contribute to the cost of land preparation.
b. distribution of Urea 46% fertilizer per in kind modality to the farmers who planted their wheat lands, where each farmer will receive 200kg of fertilizer as per FSL cluster recommendation
c. distribution of cash with a value of 70$ for wheat harvesting that covers the costs of harvesting 1 hectare including transportation and packaging cost.
d. provision of field training sessions on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and distribution of GAP booklets to farmers.

In total, the project will target 2350  unique HHs, 13,160 individuals: M 2895, W 3158, B 3685, G 3422, including estimated263 PwDs.

 2) Education:
Shafak will provide safe equitable access to life-sustaining formal education services for conflict-affected school children in 58 schools in and out of camps in Al Bab, A&apos;zaz and Jebel Saman districts in Aleppo governorate, and Harim, Idleb, Jisr-Ash-Shugur districts in Idleb governorate, by providing life-saving winterization assistance through the following components:
- Provision of fuel stoves and fuel tanks as per on identified needs assessed within schools in the aforementioned locations, following a review of current needs on the ground, analysis of education funding gaps by cluster and education partners and supplemented by the latest contextual information and
 - Supply of fuel for heating in 58 schools (81 shifts) for the winter period of 2021-2022, to ensure a safe and conducive environment is provided where students will thrive and learn, where harsh winters in NWS can often discourage continuous access to education.
The education activities will target 41,667 conflict-affected school children (19,923 boys, 21,744 girls 53.56% IDPs, of them 919 CwDs), along with 1,606 teachers and education personnel (867 men, 739 women).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency food support in response to upcoming winter and floods</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to contribute to preparedness and response efforts for the upcoming winter and flood season and address the identified urgent food needs of the most vulnerable people in northwest Syria. Through this intervention, 8,182 Households (40,910 individuals) will receive Emergency Food Parcels and Ready to Eat (RTE) Meals in Idleb Governorate during the upcoming winter season. The project is developed based on the anxious need on the ground to get prepared for the upcoming winter and floods. Islamic Relief plans to target the most vulnerable households in Maaret Tamsrin, Dana, and Harim sub-districts. Selection of the targeted location was based on Islamic Relief&apos;s monitoring findings from the previous response to the floods during January 2021 as well as from the NFIs and FSL cluster on-going updates. The targeted areas are also ranked at severity three and four as indicated in the HNO 2021 food security sector severity target sheet. 

Islamic Relief plans to distribute 6,000 RTEs for one time off in response to the seasonal floods between December 2021 until February 2022. In addition, Islamic Relief will target 2,182 households with emergency food parcels support for three months starting from October 2021 until December 2021 to support those most vulnerable during the upcoming winter season. The project will support extremely vulnerable families (with a focus on female and child-headed households). Islamic Relief will conduct a detailed household-level need assessment to identify 8,182 households to provide the Food Parcels and RTE Meals. 

Islamic Relief has been responding to the seasonal floods and winterization needs on the ground to address the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable conflict-affected Syrians. IR will build upon its response experience in implementing the proposed activities. In coordination with CAFOD and DARNA, Islamic Relief with respect to its seasonal flood&#x2019;s response contributed to the efforts of reducing the suffering of the most vulnerable Syrians from the effects of the rainstorm that hit various locations in Idlib amp Aleppo province causing flash floods in January 2021. Through the response 30,250 flood affected individuals received RTE food rations and winterization items (fuel blankets insulators mattresses). in Addition, IR has reached out to over 16,000 HHs/ 90,000 individuals was provided winterization and food support from Islamic Relief own fund in last winter season. 

Given the particular sensitivities related to women engaging in project activities a careful weighing of the risks associated with providing such support will be undertaken to ensure that no harm comes to beneficiaries or field staff. The project will seek to prioritize women and those with disabilities by tailoring the support provided, in an effort to better respond to their specific needs and concerns. IR staff will organize an awareness session for IR staff and gather medical face masks, Alcohol sterile, LaTeX gloves, and thermometer for COVID-19 protection.

As part of exit strategy, all relevant stakeholders will be informed about project closure. Lesson learnt from the implementation will be shared with FSL cluster members to improve the quality of the programmes.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhance the production capacity of NW bakeries and supporting the Affected host communities and IDPs with Free Bread and short-term work opportunities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention is a preliminary step to ensure more sustainability not only by delivering flour and yeast via the previous interventions and supporting bakeries to keep them in their business but also to conduct rehabilitation and support to the semi-functioning bakeries. In practical terms, families across Syria have faced heavily eroded employment opportunities, skyrocketing prices and shortages of basic goods and services, and widespread deterioration of household coping mechanisms. Food prices, in addition to other factors such as periodic shortages of staples, have led to a record 12.4 million people in Syria now estimated to be food insecure, an increase of 4.5 million in just one year. 

The overall objective of the proposed project is to enhance bread production and short-term income-generating opportunities of affected households and communities in northwest Syria especially among the most vulnerable households and communities. The proposed intervention focus on i) Improve the production capacity of the existed bakeries ii) Improve the access to free bread iii) Restore income-generating assets amp increase bread production and improved economic conditions and labor market opportunities in the targeted communities. 

Over 1863 households (11175 individuals: 2,163 men, 2,235 women, 3,129 boys, 3,688 girls)) are to be reached throughout the locations targeted by this project. At least 51% of the direct beneficiaries will be women and 5% of people with disabilities. Indirect beneficiaries are estimated at over one million. Participation will be open to resident families, IDPs, with the exact ratio outlined in the proposal. 

The intervention logic assumes that bread bakery sector development and investment in an improved value chain, in a strategic area such as bread production, can lead to increased food security, and contribute to more resilient livelihoods while equally addressing factors that compel people to migrate by creating employment opportunities, especially for vulnerable people. It is also assumed to reduce the risk of conflicts over resources and contribute to solutions to create short-term employment opportunities and so enhance the livelihoods of vulnerable people. 

The geographical scope of the project focuses on all the northwest Syria, Aleppo and Idlib governorates as well as there is a need for bakery rehabilitation. Indicatively the 19 following locations will be targeted: Daret Azza, Batbu, Abzemo, Maaret Atarib, Atareb, Azaz, Jarez, Shamarin, Talil Elsham, Tal Elkarameh, Selwa, Atma, Harim, Salqin, Kafar Takharim, and Idleb city.

Our intervention will improve the bread production capacity of 40 bakeries, 400 households under (output 1.1). 158 tons of bread for 1263 households will be distributed free of charge for 3 months duration over 16 distribution points as cost recovery and bakery owner contribution. The distribution will be under the supervision of SR field staff (Males and females) and support from the representatives from the local communities (output 1.3). Moreover, 197 cash-for-work workers will be selected to implement activities related to bakery rehabilitation, equipment amp infrastructure maintenance, and distribution of free-of-charge bread (output 1.2).

SR field team will take all preventing precautions from COVID-19 during the implementation as per the recommendation of Nutrition Cluster, UNICEF, COVID-19 Taskforce, and WHO. SR will start early procurement in order to fill the gap of bread production early in the project period, so SR can start the bread provision on time, however, all the contracting will be after signing the agreement. SR will conduct an awareness campaign on the best practices towards COVID-19, mechanisms for reporting violations (GBV and SEA).

Monitoring and Evaluation activities will be conducted throughout the project which will include: Distribution Monitoring, Verification visits, and PDM.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to provide the most urgent life-saving humanitarian assistance through integrated intervention including winterization interventions and CCCM components to the most vulnerable people to alleviate suffering in high-needs and underserved in random camps 10,532 HHs, 58,117 Ind (100 % IDPs) 11,769 Male, 13,998 Women, 16,300 boys, and16,050 girls) in 48 random camps located in Maaret Tamsrin, Atareb, Kelly, Dana, and Darkush sub-districts at Idleb and Aleppo governorates.

Under SNFI sector, the project will target 18 IDPs camps. 4283 HHs (22989 Ind, 4996 M, 5554 W, 6386 B, and 6053 G) will receive lifesaving appropriate winter assistance that is effective to prevent the negative effects of the winter season through providing 750 kg olive pomace to each HHs.

Under CCCM sector, the project will target 9964 HHs (55164 Ind, 11097 M, 13281 W, 15468 B, and 15318 G) in 46 IDPs camps. 
The main interventions as follow: 
- Establishment of 63 fire, care, and maintenance points.
- Equipping the fire, care, and maintenance points with both fire and response equipment in addition to maintenance tools and equipment according to FTF recommendations.
- Forming, training, and qualifying fire fighting committees.
- Awareness-raising campaign for fire prevention including some of the sessions of mechanisms for reporting violations (GBV and SEA) in the camps taking into account CCCM recommendations to ensuring physical distancing and COVID-19 related measures.
- Forming of maintenance committees in the targeted camps, with technical competencies in harmony with type and nature of expected maintenances, in close coordination with camp management and committees, besides providing these committees with rapid vocational training. 
- Conducting required care and maintenance in the targeted camps by the formed maintenance committees.

 Prevention procedures for COVID-19 will be insisted before, during, and after the distribution, including distancing, procedures of sterilization staff and beneficiaries, awareness posters, crowds management, sterilizing DPs according to WASH amp health cluster&#x2019;s recommendations, in addition, to allocate an employee to monitor and make sure that all COVID-19 prevention procedures were applied.
ATAA will coordinate with SNFI, CCCM clusters, and other NGOs working in the same areas to avoid any duplication in targeting beneficiaries.
The project will ensure equal access for both genders with priority for women, children headed households, PwDs, and the elderly.
ATAA project staff will include female and male members trained on the protection principles and gender equality.

ATAA organization has developed experience in face to face distribution modality as it has been applied in several In-kind distribution projects in open areas near on inside the targeted camps, which will be adopted in this intervention, where there are separated lines for males and females, shaded areas, chairs, and drinkable water point
Distribution in door-to-door modality will be used in delivering agreed-on assistance to all of the elderlies, pregnant women, female head households, and people with disabilities. in addition to all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 viral infection.
Regarding the applying olive pit fuel, the findings of needs assessment showed that  66% of respondents answered that the most used material for heating last winter was olive pomace, moreover 76% of them reported It is the preferred material to be used for heating as their heaters are adopted to use olive pomace as fuel for heating.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Safe and Dignified Shelter Solutions For IDPs in Northwest Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Syrian conflict entered its eleventh year and remains one of the most complex humanitarian crises in the world which has relied on humanitarian financing to respond to critical needs. Humanitarian needs of people in Northwest Syria (NWS) remain critical, with 3.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2021. 2.8 million are internally displaced persons (IDPs), with the majority (80%) women and children. Shelter remains a priority need for most IDPs. 67% of IDP HHs in NWS face shelter hazard and 36% live in emergency shelter and report lack of space as primary concern. Many IDPs live in inadequate, non-durable and unsafe shelter in multi-occupancy or damaged residential buildings or Collective Centers (CCs) while 6% live in unfinished buildings. CARE&#x2019;s Rapid WASH Assessment conducted in 449 IDP sites in NWS in Jan21 found 86% with regular access to water rely entirely on humanitarian actors (mostly water trucking) to cover daily needs. Most sites don&#x2019;t have functioning water network systems. Women and girls living in IDP sites lacking nearby water sources expressed fear of harassment on the way to collect water. IDPs continue to rely on humanitarian actors for removal of sewage wastewater through daily desludging services. 65% reported that IDP sites didn&#x2019;t have safe and adequate sanitation facilities. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated humanitarian situation in NWS. On 31st May, the total COVID-19 cases reached to 23,541 individuals. 20,644 people recovered while there were 670 deaths.
In 2020, CARE, using SCHF funds, rehabilitated and extended the capacity of Zoghara Camp in Jarablus to host more than 875HHs. Using ECHO funding, CARE installed durable dignified shelter units targeting 450HHs in the same camp.
Under this project, CARE proposes to enhance shelter and living conditions to mitigate protection, safety and GBV risks by providing safe and dignified shelter units for 400 IDP HHs in Zoghara camp living in tents. CARE will integrate GBV risk identification into its assessment and analysis processes and center GBV risk mitigation interventions across its shelter programming. CARE will utilize the Shelter and GBV tools developed together with IOM, IASC GBV Guidelines (Shelter Thematic Area Guide) and CARE GenderampShelter guidelines to ensure gender and protection are addressed at project stages.
The project will be integrated and aligned with CARE&apos;s existing interventions in Zoghara camp. CARE currently provides all WASH services in the camp through SCHF and other funds. CARE is also working to connect the newly constructed improved shelter units to a new sewage network linking to decentralized wastewater treatment units, where the effluent will be used for irrigation purposes. CARE constructed a flood management system in the camp to drive rainwater out of the camp, consisting of open and closed drainage pipes and manholes. CARE supports other basic needs through monthly cash and livelihoods support by hiring IDPs for agriculture and WASH activities in the camp, which will continue until Dec2021.
Through the proposed intervention CARE will ensure community participation and planning, where specific needs, risks and concerns of diverse groups are addressed from the start of programming. CARE will ensure women and girls equally participate in community consultations and planning and address their specific needs, risks and concerns to mitigate GBV risks. CARE will emphasize diversity approach, considering that women and girls are not a homogeneous group and those with different vulnerabilities may face different GBV risks. Furthermore, CARE will recruit GBV field workers to support GBV Risk Mitigation processes and work with the Shelter team. This will support the Shelter team with &#x2018;on-the-job&apos; supervision and capacity building in integrating GBV risk mitigation into daily tasks. Lastly, field staff will be trained on information dissemination toolkit and safety audit toolk</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve the shelter conditions in informal camps by covering the basic infrastructure to prevent floods and enhance IDP access to their shelter.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The harsh weather conditions had exacerbated the already dire needs of the IDP population, including shelter, and non-food items (NFIs). As floods were a regular occurrence during the last winter season. Almost 123,000 IDPs across 310 IDP sites in northwest Syria were reportedly affected by recent floods. Over 22,000 tents were either destroyed or damaged.
With this deterioration of the living conditions, and lack of assistance to provide adequate shelter with considering the current outbreak of COVID-19 and rising number of confirmed cases in northwest Syria, degraded sanitation conditions and overcrowding in camps and informal sites are of particular concern this and coming winter.
IYD through this project aims to ensure the displaced Syrian families live in Improved shelter conditions in informal camps by covering the basic infrastructure to prevent floods and enhance IDP access to their shelter.
Therefore affected locations will be supported with camp improvement and enhancing the infrastructure, to mitigate and protect IDPs&apos; shelters from expected flooding. The main activities will provide shelter services for the IDPs as the following: 
1-graveling of the camp&apos;s roads to enhancing the status of the roads inside the camps to facilitate the IDPs movement especially during the winter season, IYD will install two layers of gravel with an average of 30 cm thickness (or more as needed) and compact with mechanical machines to form a solid layer above the roads to protect them from any rainfall.
2-Drainage system: the poor drainage and persistent standing water in and around shelters can lead to numerous health and sanitation problems in camps and informal sites extending the adverse effects of flooding beyond the event itself as well the camps are not prepared to contain the rainfall volume, to reduce the probability of a flood in the camps IYD will establish a drain system in the lowlands and beside the roads, this drain system connected with manholes and closed drainage system to collect the rainwater
this network resends the rainwater to the mainline, this mainline extends outside the camps to the nearest valley or sewage line. Moreover, culverts under main roads will be constructed when required.
3-Tents ground insulation (tent leveling): insulating the tent&apos;s grounds by raising the ground 20 cm up the ground by fixing bricks around the tent and fill the middle space with gravel and soft sand to be compacted manually or mechanically to make a fixed base to tents.
This activity prevents moisture and medium flood during rainstorms entering the tent, also makes an insulation layer that prevents the entry of insects and rodents into the tent.
4-Installing of solar lighting poles: To improve the assess in the IDPs sites and  the camp&apos;s facilities through installing solar lighting poles in the main and the sub roads in each camp, those solar poles will provide protected access to the IDPs in the targeted sites.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Delivery of life-saving protection services to the most at-risk and marginalized women, girls and boys residing in IDP camps and host communities in Azaz Sub-district, with particular focus on widows and persons with disabilities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this project, RI and its partner SEMA aim to provide prevention and response to GBV and CP services as well as empowerment activities for women and children living in 10 camps Alharamean, Alshohda, Talgeben, Ewaa shamareen, Altawheed, Alarmota, Alandane, Alresala, Ahl-alsham, Alresala/random in Azaz subdistrict, Aleppo governorate, with particular attention to widows living there as they are numerous and exposed to multiple protection risks. In Alshohda camp, moreover, there is a dedicated and separated section for only widows&#x2019; and their children (widow camp), situation which creates marginalization, additional protection concerns and vulnerabilities for this particular group.
Ensuring participation of individuals from the general population will ensure acceptance of services, avoid stigmatization of widows and the development of social networks with women and girls living in the general population sections. These locations were selected based on a recent needs&#x2019; assessment conducted by SEMA, which identified great vulnerabilities and gaps in service provision in the target locations. The population living in these camps are particularly at risk of various forms of GBV including emotional abuse, physical assault, sexual harassment, early forced marriage, and child labour is widespread. 
While SEMA will be responsible for the direct implementation of the proposed activities, RI will provide supervision and capacity building covering the sectors of intervention though its existing technical capacity. After an inception phase where safety audits will be implemented to select the most appropriate, safe and accessible locations in the selected camps, SEMA will establish two women and girls safe spaces (WGSS) in Alshohda and Altawheed  camps and one child friendly space (CFS) in Alshoda camp. SEMA will also continue supporting one existing CFS in Azaz community (Amal Centers), which is located close to the camps. During the inception phase RI will train SEMA project staff to ensure quality delivery of services. Moreover, extensive outreach activities will be conducted throughout the project to ensure the population in the camps are aware of services and activities being implemented. 
The GBV services that will be provided are case management, community based and focus psychosocial support (PSS) services as well as awareness raising and empowerment activities. Moreover, in order to strengthen the community approach RI and SEMA will support the establishment of 10 women&#x2019;s committees to foster participation of women in decision making structures as well as build on community protective mechanisms already in place. Under CP, the project will provide CP case management, community- PSS, parenting skills training, awareness raising and recreational activities, identification and referral of cases, as well as child protection monitoring. SEMA will facilitate the establishment of a community committee in the camps and ensure appropriate training. This community Committee will be responsible for raising awareness on CP concerns in the camps as well as identification and referral of children at risks to response services provided at the CFS. Moreover, SEMA will provide 80 children with disabilities with special needs rehabilitation (SNR) in the Azzaz CFS and conduct dedicated, tailored parenting sessions for their caregivers.
All activities will be implemented while adhering to strict COVID 19 prevention measures such as reduced numbers of participants in group activities, social distancing and the provision of PPE for both staff and beneficiaries.
Throughout the project cycle RI will provide organizational support to SEMA as well as technical capacity building, covering GBV, CP and PSS, to ensure quality delivery of services and compliance with international standards and best practices. 
The overall target of the proposal is 12,280 individuals: 2,500 males (500 men and 2000 boys) and 9,600 females (4,640 girls and 4,960 women).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated and inclusive life-saving response to critical protection needs for conflict affected populations in North West of Syria, with a focus on most vulnerable groups, such as persons with disabilities.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed action aims at providing inclusive and integrated emergency response to critical needs in protection for conflict affected populations in the North West of Syria (NWS), with a focus on the most vulnerable groups. The strategy of response is developed coherently with the strategic objectives of HRP 2021, particularly OS 2 and it takes into account key protection considerations following a gender, diversity, and age informed approach, while focusing on high vulnerability groups, and strengthening inclusion of Persons with Disabilities (PwD). The logic of intervention is aligned with the second strategic objective of the allocation strategy (ASO2), and it is structured on two main pillars: 
1- Enhance protective environment through addressing widespread explosive ordnance contamination. HI teams and implementing partners will provide direct Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) sessions at community level, including community impact survey. To build on sustainability, HI will also implement trainings of trainers aiming to build local capacities and extend the impact of the action on the long term. Victims will be referred to internal (Inclusion and/ or Prosthesis services) or external services.

2- Enhance inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in society and humanitarian assistance through mutually supportive programming to increase their participation. Through the implementation of a twin-track approach, the logic of intervention will combine a package of activities aimed at empowering PWD from one hand and building a more inclusive and accessible living environment at the community level, on another hand. Considering the technicality of the activities, HI will be implementing directly in the identified areas of intervention. 

HI will mainstream COVID-19 activities across the overall strategy of intervention. Key messaging and the provision of PPE and hygiene items will be integrated in the activities package.

Concerning partnerships, HI is working with local partners since 2012, and developed strong skills and capacities. The proposed partner is currently working with HI in targeted areas. HI will ensure capacity building and training to partners&#x2019; staff for technical teams, programs, MEAL and support departments. HI will refer to its partnership management guidance and policies

High-needs and unserved areas in North Aleppo are prioritized. The strategy of response is founded on HI long standing operational presence in targeted areas of intervention lessons learnt from previous similar interventions long term partnership with targeted local implementing organizations in-depth understanding and knowledge of needs and socio-cultural dynamics at the community level. The overall logic of intervention and modalities have been designed based on conflict sensitivity considerations.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing comprehensive WASH assistance to the most vulnerable populations in North West Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aligned with the priorities of the third reserve allocation of SCHF, SI proposes to address urgent lifesaving WASH needs in Aghtrin, Azaz and Suran, contributing to the preparedness for the winter/flood season to prevent and limit the impact of imminent flood damage. With this intervention, SI aims to cover critical WaSH needs and services in areas in which it has an historical presence. 

Humanitarian needs in North West Syria, including Azaz, continue unabated, driven by the ongoing conflict, the economic downturn, the COVID-19 pandemic and seasonal environmental and climate change. Gaps identified include a lack of water tanks and sustainable solid waste solutions (garbage bins, sewage networks). Findings from the CCCM Cluster confirm that, despite the humanitarian presence, WaSH needs are still not fully covered in Azaz. In fact, according to Humanitarian Needs Assessment Programme (HNAP) report of Dec 2020, 40 % of IDPs in NWS report that water is their first priority. In terms of infrastructure, at least 70% of sewage is discharged untreated, while at least half of the sewerage systems are not functional and 26% of garbage is inappropriately disposed within communities (HNO 2020), with 64% of water stations not functional, according to the Syrian Water Resources Platform.

SI addresses identified needs with a comprehensive WASH package for IDPs in Aghtrin, Azaz and Suran more specifically in the camps and Informal Settlements of Kaer Kalbin, Al-Wash, Ziadiah, Al-Rajab, Dar El Keram, Al-Fatih (Mareen ), Ahl Alsham Settlements, including:

	Daily supply of safe, sufficient and treated water in the form of water points for an average of 35 Liter per person per day through water trucking and pumping (running cost). Water distribution and quality monitoring will be implemented in the full respect of the WASH cluster technical recommendations
	Procurement, distribution and installation of water storage containers for water domestic use and hygiene behaviors
	Rehabilitation and maintenance of the sewage network in Dar Al-Keram 
	Rehabilitation of the water network in Ehtemalat village and dar El-Keram camp
	construction of latrine blocks for men women and PWD in Kaer Kalbin and Dar Al-Keram
	Solid waste collection and management through provision of adequate solid containers and waste removal.
	Life-saving hygiene promotion awareness will be ensured within and beyond recently displaced people to prevent water and vector borne diseases. 

Targeting will be based on needs analysis, inter-agency coordination, and SI ability to maintain humanitarian safe and principled access. Beneficiary selection criteria for individual activities will vary, but always be based on needs and vulnerabilities. Gender equality will be prioritized and beneficiary engagement throughout the project cycle will ensure transparency and awareness of project activities.

This project is in accordance with the first Strategic Objective of the interagency Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP): Provide life-saving humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on those in areas with high severity of needs. SI will target locations ranked by SCHF as having high and medium needs, in which it will address Allocation Strategic Objective 2 (ASO2).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency WASH Response to IDPs in Idleb Camps</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project supports IDPs in the camps of Dana and Maret Tamsrin sub-districts by extension and construction of water infrastructure (water network, sewage network)  and connecting them to nearby borehole and water station, in addition to providing other WASH services in these camps based on their needs  in ordet to provide  comprehensive emergency life-saving package. In camps where it is not possible to be connected to water sources, there will be water trucking with FRC 0.2 - 0.5 so these people get lifesaving humaintarian assistance. sanitation facilities and mitigation measures against Covid-19. It aims to ensure that IDPs in the targeted camps can maintain or improve their hygiene behaviours, particularly for those who have settled in the camps as their last resort and are more vulnerable to the risks of Covid-19 pandemic. In total, 24,190 individuals (5,806 men, 6,047women, 6,533 boys, 5,804 girls) will benefit from the activities of this project. 


The project consists of five main activities:
1 - Providing chlorinated water and water storage tanks (average of 35 l/p/d, FRC 0.2 - 0.5)
2 - Expanding water network, and water drainage and sewage networks in camps.
3 - Providing and installing sanitation facilities (latrines and septic tanks) in addition to regular desludging.
4 - Solid waste management and hygiene sessions in all targeted camps
5 - Hygiene promotion activities.

The interventions are designed based on the needs that were reported through WASH cluster gap list in addition to confirming the needs by assessments conducted by HIHFAD. Throughout the project, COVID-19 mitigation procedures will be observed. Gender, age and disability inclusion will be taken into consideration. The latrine blocks are gender segregated and will be equipped with ramps and handrail to make them accessible to all people including people with disability. In addition, adults diapers will be distributed to the elderly or persons with disabilities who have a difficulty to access common latrines. male and female cleaners for the latrines and maintenance workers will be selected among the IDPs in the target camps in order to ensure involvement of IDPs during implementation as they were also involved during the design of the project through the needs assessment. In Damaet Nazeh and Sanabil Alkheir , desludging will be for 3 months, during this period the sewage network will be ready and all sewage lines are connected to it ( rain drainage will be constructed in these two camps. While in Al Faraj camp, sewage network will be expanded to cover all HHs, and the already existing water network will be expanded so no water trucking will be needed in this camp. Om Jaran and Alsalihyah camps will be targeted with lifesaving activities. before the beginning of winter all septic tanks will be desludged and regularly monitored to prevent any overflow(more details in detailed needs attached excel sheet).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide sustainable and life-saving WASH assistance to the most vulnerable people in underserved areas with high WASH needs</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In general, 60% to 70% of the population in camps relying on water trucking and often unsafe water supply modalities to meet their water needs. In many parts of Syria, the WASH infrastructure and service provision require significant repair and operational support, with the continued transmission and outbreak of COVID-19. 
The proposed action will provide life-saving assistance to increase and sustain access to critical WASH supplies and services in underserved camps of Atareb, Maaret Tamsrin, Idleb, and Dana Sub Districts, These areas are considered high priority and classified as high severity of need by the WASH cluster. COVID-19 prevention measures have been incorporated across the program design.	
The project activities will immediately increase access to critical life-saving WASH services, while also ensuring the long-term sustainability of service provision through establishing renewable energy modalities in Maaret Tamsrin Sub District in 2 camps (Qaryet Alkuweyt, and Alqatary) and establish water unit and provide them with OampM training, and work closely with ATAA engineering team. 

ATAA planning to respond to 26,799 IDPs in 19 camps (Please see the ATAA Project Locations table in attached sheet), as two-sectors:
- First sector: 	
2 camps in Maaret Tamsrin Sub District.
# of BNFS: 4291, and # of HHs: 660
Provide rehabilitation to the water station in Qaryet Alkuweyt camp, and installing a new water network and connect it with the main water tank (Capacity of 80 M3), also connecting the Alqatary network camp with the new water system, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of service provision through establish renewable energy modalities.
Purchases and install water storage tanks (1 M3) to 300 HHs and connect all water tanks in the targeted camps with the water system.

During the rehabilitation process, ATAA will supply safe and adequate water via water trucking on a daily basis for a short period (First 2 months) to all IDPs in the targeted camps (Ratio 40L/Person/Day).
After the completion of the rehabilitation process, ATAA will establish water units and provide them with OampM training, also provide OampM costs for 3 months (During the winter), and after the winter is over the water station can be work on a daily basis by the solar system.

- Second sector: 
17 camps in Atareb, Maaret Tamsrin, Idleb, and Dana Sub Districts.
# of BNFS: 22508, and # of HHs: 3893
Provision of life-saving WASH activities to the camps cannot connect to any water system and are in crucial need of adequate and clean water via water trucking on a daily basis and for 7 months (minimum 40L/Person/Day in summer season, and 30 to 35 L/Person/Day in winter season).
Purchases and install communal water storage tanks (5 M3) with establishing the gender-separated water taps in 17 camps.

Mainstreaming COVID-19 response throughout all regular WASH activities is crucial to mitigate risks, therefore, the project activities will be contributing to the prevention of COVID-19 and will be a key consideration for this project. 
ATAA will distribute essential hygiene materials (3 rounds of soap) to all HHs project camps in line with hygiene promotion and awareness activities to increase understanding of appropriate COVID-19 prevention and response behaviors.

ATAA will help to improve clean-living environmental conditions by providing solid waste collection (capacity of 100 Liters for each 10 HHs) and conduct solid waste removal on a daily basis from all project camps.
Please note Ihsan organization collecting solid waste on a daily basis in Sabroun (Batbo), so ATAA will not conduct this activity.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve access to WASH infrastructure for the IDPs and ensuring the delivery of life-saving services in camps in Idleb governorate.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the gap of access to water in 168 sites during the last two months where more than 182000 of the IDPs in northern Syria in need of water, and to solve the costly and short-term water supply and to reinforce the most urgent life-saving interventions, WATAN aims to enhance the long-term WASH infrastructure in the large camps with considering the water trucking service in those camps with the low number of families due to the high cost of water network comparing to the water trucking service. Also, WATAN will connect some IDP sites with sewer networks alongside providing essential lifesaving assistance. This improvement targets the IDPs located in Dana and Maaret Tamsrin sub-districts, which located in Northwest Syria &apos;nowadays experience a funding shortfall in water and sanitation services. (OCHA, Funding gap analysis April &#x2013; June 2021) and (OCHA, Report No. 25, 2021). To this aim, the planned intervention will respond to the needs of 16101 individuals IDPs (3285 men, 4065 women, 4236 boys, and 4515 girls) through the following strategies:

 Water infrastructure for 6 IDP sites to ensure 35-40 lt/p/d during the months of July, August, September, and October, and 30-35 lt/p/d for the rest of the year of safe water for drinking and personal hygiene, which will be supported by the solar system to reduce the operational cost to almost zero. 

 Introducing solar systems in total 5 IDP sites as an energy source of water stations.

 With a sustainable and innovative solar system to ensure IDPs&apos; needs, WATAN is aware of the scope of the solar system during winter. As a response, during the rehabilitation period, water trucking service will be available for 3 months, and supporting the operation and maintenance of water systems during winter months will be applied in the water stations to ensure the functionality of the water systems and avoid any low-efficiency systems because of the weather.

 Water trucking in 11 camps, 5 camps will be covered for 3 months alongside the rehabilitation of water systems, and 6 camps will be covered for 7 months.

 Water quality monitoring will be applied to ensure that the FRC at the range of 0.2 - 0.5 mg/l.

 Construction of 2 high reservoirs (100 m3) and 1 ground reservoir (80 m3) to ensure the availably of water storage capacity in the 3 of the largest IDP sites while the other sites have water tanks as a storage capacity. 

 Rehabilitation and installation of the sewer networks in 5 IDP sites to ensure safe access to sanitation infrastructure. During the rehabilitation works, emergency sanitation services through desludging will be provided for three months.

 The intervention will cover solid waste management activities on daily basis in 11 IDP sites which include the operation of waste removal trucks, and waste removal workers. The collected waste will be dumped into formal dumping sites in Dana and Maaret Tamsrin sub-districts.

 RCCE intervention that aligned with COVID-19 outbreak will be applied through sharing the awareness information among the camps&apos; residents. This activity will be a complementary activity from WATAN.

 Shelter in camps activities in 12 camps with tent installation and tent replacement, tents graveling, and NFI CRI items kits distribution will be complementary services from WATAN.

One of the key successes of this intervention that the solar system that will be installed in the &#x201C;Alfarhan&#x201D; water station and will feed Al-Karkat and Has camps, this water station will also support another 7 camps hosting 10,872 IDPs (Indirect Beneficiaries). These camps are Al-Rahma 1, Al-Rahma 2, Al-Rahma 3, Alfarhan(Doyouf Almaara), Atta alkhair, Muzun, Kelly( Al Rayhan) located in the same area.

This intervention will address the HRP Strategic Objective 1, and it is directly linked with the 2021 Third Reserve Allocation Strategic Objective and 2021 First Allocation Strategic Objective 1.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	The project is designed to meet WASH gabs needs considering the priorities interventions under SCHF 3rd reserve allocation 2021, where the proposed project is focusing on upgrading camps water systems by establishment of two water system operated by solar power, the first water system will be established in Susian-CP001034 in Aleppo governate Susian community reaching 4.060 IDPs in Susian camp, the second water system will be established in Jabal Alshekh Bahr -CP001938 camp, connecting Jabal Alshekh Bahr and  Rahma 1 (Sheikh Bahr)- CP001209 camps with water system operating by solar power reaching 4.000 IDPs. In addition, implementing sewage network for two camps in Aleppo Al Bab sub-district, Susian-CP001034 amp Al Tareek Al Azrak- CP001035 reaching 5.743 IDPs. In addition, under the proposed project, water trucking activates with will be implemented for the camps that cannot be linked with water system for duration of seven months which are:
1. Al Tareek Al Azrak CP001035.
2. Bhorta CP001968.
3. Al-Naeemiia- CP000544.
4. Al Kalamoun CP000687.
5. Al Amal(Haranbush) CP001939.
6. Murin Caps CP000690.
7. Tokan camp CP000599.
Note off, the camps targeted with water system rehabilitation will be supported for only three months with water trucking till completing the establishment process of the water system. In addition, water capita per person will be 40 liters during summer, and 35 liters per day in winter. Same as camps targeted with implementing of sewage network will be supported for only three months with septic tanks desludging till completing and linking the HHs to the implemented sewage network. Nevertheless, the following camps will be supported with septic tank desludging for a duration of seven months, where these camps cannot be linked to any near sewage network nor implementing sewage network in them:
1. Al Amal(Haranbush)- CP001939.
2. Bhorta- CP001968.
3. Al Kalamoun- CP000687.
4. Al-Naeemiia- CP000544.
5. Jabal Alshekh Bahr - CP001938.
6. Murin Caps- CP000690.
7. Tokan camp- CP000599.
Moreover, the targeted camps will be supported with water tanks (In total 35 water tanks with a capacity of 2000 liters and 135 water tanks with a capacity of 1000 liters)  and garbage bins (540). SWM activity will be conducted bi-daily basis.

The Framework aims to ensure that key stakeholders&#x2019; needs, priorities, and feedback are better heard and taken into account by BINAA in the design, implementation, assessment, and evaluation of programs for sustainable transformation. In this context, the Framework&#x2032;s key objectives are to enhance transparency, good governance, and accountability across BINAA&#x2019;s operations, and ultimately to improve the quality and accessibility of services delivered to affected people.
Project level: improving the design and quality of beneficiary participation and feedback processes promoting meaningful project target group engagement throughout the project cycle stronger integration of feedback processes in project monitoring and evaluation systems and, increased attention to the development and implementation of tailored capacity-building programs enabling project target groups and other key stakeholders to sustainably engage in and manage participation and feedback processes.

To ensure gender-sensitive response, special attention will be paid to the needs of vulnerable groups of women and girls, such as female-headed households, pregnant and lactating women, women with disabilities, elderly women, adolescent girls, and children. BINAA will carry out consulting meetings with women and girls to evaluate their priorities needs to ensure that program strategies mitigate the exposure to risk. At each stage of the response, the BINAA team will facilitate a gender balance as far as possible, with a minimum percentage of the team and the beneficiaries being female. BINAA will go beyond &#x201C;Do No Harm&#x201D; by designing and</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhance Safe Access to Formal Education Services for School-Aged-Children in The Underserved and High-Needs Areas of Atareb, Dana, Darkosh, and Qourqeena Sub-districts</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention&apos;s overall objective is to improve equitable access for school-aged children to safe, inclusive, and quality learning environments to foster their resilience. This will be achieved through implementing a package of education activities to 19 formal schools in Atareb, Dana, Darkosh, and Qourqeena sub-districts which are located in underserved and high-needs areas, where11,766 children (5,581 boys and 6,185 girls &apos;including 302 CwD ~2.5%&apos;, 5-17 years old) are enrolled (65% IDPs). The project builds on previous projects&apos; successes, funded by Save the Children, UNICEF, and SCHF. The proposed schools need funding for the time being. So, there will be a big chance for 11,766 school-aged children to lose their education opportunities in addition to 480 education personnel who will lose their only source of income in case these schools aren&#x2019;t supported. By supporting a quality learning environment, IRD seeks to increase children&apos;s enrollment in the targeted schools. To achieve this, IRD will conduct digital Back To Learning (BTL) campaigns &apos;to minimize gathering and as a precautionary measure for COVID-19&apos; in 14 communities for raising awareness among parents and community members regarding the importance of education. All enrolled students will receive formal education services using the SiG curriculum for 9 months (Sep 21 to May 22). 20% of these students will conduct ASER tests twice. The baseline will be conducted during October 2021 and the end line will be conducted during April 2022 to measure the learning outcomes of the project on students. To improve the students&#x2019; well-being during the project lifetime, all enrolled students will receive recreational activities from their classroom teachers. All teachers will be provided with monthly incentives to increase their motivation and ensure their retention in schools. The project will cover the schools&#x2019; monthly operational costs, including recreational materials, refreshment, cleaning, hygiene materials, and stationery, conducting light repairs for schools, provision of students&apos; and teachers&apos; kits. The quality of education will be improved through contextualized and targeted teacher training and further support to their professional development within each school by delivering (CSG, TiCC, PSEA, COVID-19) trainings. IRD will cover the costs of these trainings from another funding. Parents Teachers Associations (PTAs) will be a component in the activities of this project. Quarterly meetings for PTAs members will be held to discuss what was achieved in the last period and set with IRD&#x2019;s staff plans for the upcoming period. Due to COVID-19, there will be comprehensive precautionary measures in the 19 schools, including periodic sterilization process for classrooms and WASH facilities, awareness sessions for students, training for teachers and educational staff, and sterilization provision materials for all schools. IRD will re-utilize all the preexisted IT equipment (laptops and printers) from its previous various education projects.

Plan B: 
All schools are now operational. In case of COVID-19 out-break again, schools may be suspended and close temporarily. As a plan B, the project will adapt the distance learning modality tested during 2020 through 4 education projects implemented by IRD and provide children with internet vouchers (which will be covered from running costs). WhatsApp groups will be created per subject and per class. Teachers will prepare their lessons and record the lessons to be shared with students.
In case there will be a part-time suspension, the blended education approach will be applied. It is a mix of physical attendance and distance learning methods.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing socio-economic resilience of communities affected by protracted civil war, the COVID-19 pandemic, floods, and economic deterioration through diverse livelihood opportunities for the most vulnerable groups in Dana sub-district</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project delivers a strategic and integrated set of interventions to restore local economy in Dana, Idleb in the aftermath of protracted conflict further aggravated by the impact of the COVID19 pandemic, and deteriorated economic situation. Its main objective is to create income generating opportunities for the most vulnerable IDPs, and host community members in the targeted locations. The project proposes an integrated protection and livelihood intervention where the most vulnerable households (HHs) (those being referred from child protection case management actors and GBV case management actors, as well as PwDs) will be directly targeted to enhance their resilience and promote their access to employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. The project formulation has been based in needs as identified in multi-cluster RNA/REACH/HNAP data. Besides, firsthand consultations, conducted specifically for this project with local stakeholders, have also informed the design of this proposal. By pursuing the referred main objective, the project aims to achieve the following outcomes:
1. Essential socioeconomic services are revived and restored through the creation of short-term work opportunities 
2. Access to inclusive livelihoods and entrepreneurship support is enhanced through vocational training (VT)
3. Local small businesses and entrepreneurs are supported
4. Social cohesion among IDPs and host communities is enhanced
For this purpose, a set of interlinked activities will be conducted in coordination with FSL, WASH, Shelter and Protection clusters. Firstly, 10 essential socioeconomic infrastructures will be rehabilitated in Dana, through the creation of 240 short-term work opportunities for the most vulnerable HHs, in coordination with the FSL partners to ensure that the intervention is synergistic with food assistance. Secondly, the project foresees the identification of 450 HHs with a specific focus on severe economic vulnerability to provide them with VT linked to either CfW opportunities or small business support. These opportunities will be directly aiming to address Protection concerns, targeting PwDs, GBV survivors and HHs where cases of child labor have been identified.Thirdly, the project will identify and provide business support to 120 small businesses affected by floods, economic recession and COVID19 in the targeted location, to boost economic recovery. Moreover, the project is specifically designed to foster social cohesion among IDPs and host communities through the establishment of a Socio-Economic Empowerment Community Committee (SEECC) for advising the design and implementation of the project activities, fostering local ownership and ensuring sustainability of the achievements of the project upon its completion. 
This project will directly benefit 373,320 individuals living in 9 communities and 18 camps in Dana (M:132980, F:94450, B:64410, G:81480, PWD: 5690). 
UNDP is the global lead agency in Early Recovery and Livelihoods Restoration with extensive experience in ERL projects, including inside NWS.UNDP will work in partnership with SARD, a national NGO which has experience in both ERL and Protection projects. UNDP will be responsible for overall management of the project and oversight against programmatic and fiduciary risks through efficient contractual arrangements and administrative support. This will ensure timely implementation of the project, and high quality of activities and program deliverables. Moreover, UNDP&#x2019;s ERL team will provide technical guidance and expertise to ensure the quality and appropriateness of livelihood activities, the sustainability of the business support which will improve the effectiveness of the project and better outcomes for BNs. The added value of SARD is anchored around their experience in both ERL and Protection activities in Idleb, which will be a key to ensure the smooth transitioning between protection activities to livelihood activities for the most vulnerable</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project targets 4 communities in Suran&#x2013;Aleppo, Azaz and Aghtrin sub-districts, all these camps located in underserved areas, the project consists of two sectors that complement each other:

1- Under FSL: The project target 1123 families with 8 rounds of regular (monthly) food assistance:
- Cash for food: GAN will target 1123 families in camps with cash for food, the cash intervention is feasible in these camps as they all have access to different main markets in the targeted communities, eight rounds of cash for food will be distributed between Jul 2021 to Mar 2022, each round consists of two phases, 20 days for distribution and 10 days for validation and PDM, 60$ will be allocated for each family as recommended by FSL cluster and CWG, GAN conducted a deep coordination with different partners working in the same area as detailed in the coordination section, although the data gained form the FSL cluster indicate this areas as high priority ranking and no partner plan to target the same vulnerable and underserved camps, according to the interviews and assessment, 94% said that the first priority is food, the proposed modality is a cash for food, as it is considered one of the most effective modality since the markets are available near camps.
Monthly market assessment in terms of availability of the items, prices, and accessibility will be conducted to ensure the local markets are functioning and all beneficiaries have good and equal accessibility to the different goods.

2- Under ERL: GAN through its sub-implementing partner (POINT organization) aims to integrate its intervention and target same affected and most severe communities, IDPs and host communities who are till now relying on aids through provision of livelihood opportunities. The selection of targeted beneficiaries under this ERL component will be from the list of the FSL beneficiaries that will be supported in this FSL intervention and the ones that were supported in the previous FSL project currently being finalized by GAN (SCHF 16291) according to an eligibility and vulnerability criteria with giving priorities to higher vulnerability scores and women headed HHs and PWDs in order to provide a comprehensive integrated intervention.

This will be done by starting with Market mapping to identify market gaps and needs according to which the VT training topics and domains will be identified, then GAN and POINT will start several advocacy and community sensitization activities that aims at engaging the communities, explaining the merits of the intervention and the idea of SMEs, raising awareness of the importance of sustaining small businesses, and clearly communicating the selection criteria in order to reduce the risk of tensions among communities.

After that, the selected beneficiaries will be verified and then will be invited to join the vocational training which will target 100 persons and last for two months on topics that will be identified according to the market mapping with giving priorities to vocations related to PPEs production and other locally produced general covid19 protection related items such as hygiene items.
After finishing the VT, Point will deliver SME trainings of five days each for the successful applicants considering their attendance percentage in the VT, tests results and trainers&#x2019; evaluations, during this SMEs, the participants will learn about basis of business establishment, marketing financial study, feasibility, competition evaluation.. etc. after that, each participant will submit a business plan which will be evaluated by a formed committee for this purpose.
Each successful business plan with the highest scores will be supported with cash grants of 1200$ for the first 78 best plans to be paid on three tranches.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Regular E-vouchers Food Assistance and MPCA for the most vulnerable people in NW Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">**Mercy-USA will target 1799 households in Maaret Tamsrin camps with life-saving and life-sustaining food assistance.

The project consists of two components:
1-Regular food assistance through value based E-Vouchers modality, each HH will receive value 60 USD monthly for 8 months along with the FSL and CWG recommendations to cover the Kcal needs for these households to be aligned with the food component in the SMEB. 
The E-Vouchers value can be redeemed with list of food items from contracted markets/ shops in the same targeted areas.
 The beneficiaries in this component will be selected from IDPs who received RTER as response to the flood response in the last winter during January and February (including disabled, female headed households, women and young girls, PLW, and the elderly )
The targeted beneficiaries are 1299 HH (6495 individuals)  (Men 1299, Women 1429, Boys 1754, Girls 2013) (from them 625 disabled) 
Each voucher will be loaded with extra value to purchase 700 gram of soap monthly to be aligned with FSL and WASH cluster for prevention from COVID-19

2- Emergency unrestricted Cash 100 USD as one-off (Multipurpose Cash) for households who affected by any emergencies such as displacement, flood, wind, fire,,,etc 
 500 HH (2500 individuals) (Men 500, Women 550, Boys 675, Girls 775) (from them 250 disabled)

This intervention is fully aligned with the allocation strategy and FSLamp CWG  recommendations by:
-Life saving intervention to Scale-up efforts to sustain minimum food consumption needs of the most vulnerable IDPs 
-The modality is Vouchers and Cash 
-The value of the voucher is 60 USD for regular (8 months) and 100 USD for emergency (one-off)

**Mercy-USA is proposing to contract service provider for the E-vouchers in Turkey to be sub-contracted with markets in the targeted locations, these e-vouchers to be distributed one time for the beneficiaries and to be redeemed regularly on monthly basis. 
**Accountability to affected population will be given high priority by transparent beneficiary selection criteria, as well ad Complaints and Feedback mechanism which will be in place and accessible to all people through different channels.
** Mercy-USA will have MEAL plan in place in order to monitor the whole process starting from the vulnerability assessment, redemption/ distribution monitoring and post distribution monitoring with corrective measure to be taken on timely manner to ensure continuous improvement of the project implementation in order to reach the planned objectives 
**Mercy-USA considers the coordination is key aspect to apply complimentary and integration approach by coordination with other NGOs in Maaret Tamsrin Camps  in other services as well as complement with other Mercy-USA projects. 
**Disability inclusion is high priority for Mercy-USA, so many core staff were hired disabled to ensure the inclusion and design all projects by include their perspectives to incorporate inclusion in all phases of projects</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide of life-saving assistance and support the self-resilience of crisis-affected population in rural of Aleppo.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project pursuits scaling-up efforts to sustain minimum food consumption needs of the most vulnerable IDPs and host community population in western rural of Aleppo province.
This intervention will complement our ongoing project and will make big contribution towards addressing the critical food insecurity and instability of the IDPs in the camps through distribution of free bread as well as supporting the livelihood assets through supporting the wheat value chain and access to agriculture.
MASRRAT will Support the local wheat value chain through marketing, wherein MASRRAT has an ongoing project supporting 600 wheat farmers beneficiaries in Aleppo countryside (funded by OCHA). So, MASRRAT will purchase 360 tons of wheat seeds with supported price from the beneficiaries and other farmers (600 kg from each farmer) based on specific criteria for ensuring the pureness of the wheat. The purchased wheat will be used as follows:
1. 240 tons of the purchased wheat will be milled to produce 192 tons of wheat flour and 48 tons of wheat bran (80% + 20% of the purchased wheat seeds) and supply flour directly to bakeries and provide free bread distribution (175.8 tons white bread and 55 tons of bran bread) to 2400 of the most vulnerable IDP HHs for four consecutive months in the targeted locations whose access to subsidized bread is limited. Wherein, MASRRAT will contract with four bakeries to increase the community participation and reduce work pressure and to ensure that the bakeries will not exceed the daily production capacity which will affect the bread quality (part of the resulted wheat bran will be used to cover the costs of milling the wheat flour).
2. The other part of the purchased wheat seeds (120 tons will produce 114 tons of pure wheat after screening, 5% impurities) will be used for improving access to agriculture by distributing it to 456 new wheat farmers. Every beneficiary will receive 250 kg of wheat seeds, one fuel voucher for supplementary irrigation 125 $ as well as three technical training sessions about GAP. The beneficiaries of wheat activity will be from the local community and IDPs who settled for a while, own or renting land between 7 to10 donums suitable for wheat, as well as the farmers who meet the selection criteria.
This project will support 14420 beneficiaries affected by the Syrian crisis (3750 men, 3186 women, 3648 boys and 3835 girls including 303 PWDs) by promoting their accessibility to the humanitarian assistance significantly. All the people in the targeted villages and markets will benefit directly/indirectly from the project where the wheat will be available in the markets at normal prices. The project is designed with consideration to the cluster and WHO recommendation on prevention and mitigation measures related to COVID-19 especially during the distribution of support and conducting trainings. In addition, protection cluster recommendations were taken into consideration, wherein all the population in the targeted locations will benefit from MASRRAT protection Centers in Aleppo, in the event of any GBV referral cases.
The target villages in Jebel Samman district/Atareb sub-district are considered from the most densely populated areas:
Jeineh 6272 HCs amp 2580IDPs
Atareb 23950 HCs amp 8632IDPs
Kafr Karmin 7100 HCs amp 6000 IDPs
Babka 2800 HCs amp 1650 IDPs
Abin Samaan 12920 HCs amp 6257IDPs
Batbu 4800 HCs amp 5030 IDPs
Kafr Naseh Elatareb 3960 HCs amp 7491 IDPs</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is designed to scaled-up life-saving assistance, safe and continued access to basic essential services, and the improved protective environment particularly for vulnerable groups such as women and children (2100 HH, 10500 individuals) in Jarablous sub-district which is a high priority ranking in the allocation paper, by providing Life-saving humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on underserved areas with high severity of needs 
. The assistance will take place in 10 communities taking into consideration equity in access, quality, responsiveness and participation and resilience the intervention can be summarized as the following:
FSL Cluster: the project will cover the distribution of Food Rations (2100 FR) for 2500 HH settled in 10 communities for 8 months. These food rations which are according to FSL Cluster standards will be distributed once a month and for 8 months by informing the targeted HHs about the timing and the location as well, taking into consideration the COVID-19 preventive measures such as distributing PPE kits for the teams and distributing soap for the benefited families. This intervention is classified under ASO2
Beneficiaries will be selected based on the proposed vulnerability criteria as reflected below together with other eligibility criteria as determined as follows after coordination with the local authorities: 
have No food assistance from NGOs.
A household with a special needs member.
A household with an elderly member.
The number of children more than 2.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Scale-up efforts to sustain minimum food consumption needs of the most vulnerable IDPs through daily bread distribution for 18964 IDPs in camps in high and medium priority in Harim and Salqin areas for 7 months.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Without adequate resources and due to the general economic deterioration in northwest Syria, people in need have continued to resort. 
The proposed project aims to Scale-up efforts to sustain the most vulnerable IDPs&apos; minimum food consumption needs through Supply flour or bread directly to bakeries and provide free bread distribution in areas with limited access to subsidized bread in sub-districts in NW Syria. 

The proposed project will serve a total population of 18964. IDPs ( 4659 Men, 5191 women, 4760 Boys, and 4354 girls) in Harim (4.3 high priority area) and Salqin ( 3.9 Medium priority area) according to the 2021 1st allocation paper in 21 IDPs camps and settlements. 
The proposed project is a continuation of last year&apos;s SKT project in the same locations. SKT has access to IDPs&apos; information and needs. Thus, the proposed project will be a continuation of the cluster plan to support the food security of the most vulnerable groups in NWs. 
The target locations have not received any food assistance from the distributed free bread during the last 2 years. The proposed free bread distribution project is the only project that partially covers the daily 2100 calories needs of the target IDPs. Suspending these services will create a huge gap and will harm the food security of these IDPs. 

According to the needs assessment results and the coordination that SKT has implemented with the other key organizations in the same target area, and as addressing to 3PM recommendation, SKT will start increasing the weight of the bread bundles to 0.9 KG. The coordination has been made with NWS FSL cluster coordination, Goal organization, and Hand in Hand to improve the technical aspects of bread distribution activities. Further coordination was done with Insan, IHH, and Mercy without limits to ensure no duplication or overlapping in targeting IDPs.

 
SKT will conduct a procurement process for flour from inside Syria - as cluster and HF recommendation-  SKT team to be transferred to the bakery. SKT will provide the operational cost for the bakery for the flour to be baked. It will provide the nylon bags, each ton of flour will provide 1277 bread bundles with  900gr for each with criteria (900gr for each family with members of 5 and less and 1.8kg for each family with members of 6 and more daily). SKT will monitor transferring the bread from the bakery to the distribution points (5 distribution points) through special cars prepared for bread transferring to save the quality of the bread (the distance between the bakery and the distribution points will not be more than 7 km maximum and the distance between each distribution point and the targeted beneficiaries will not be more than 1 km maximum), the volunteer will monitor and supervise the distribution process, a monitoring process will be conducted for the number of bread bundles baked, the weight of bread bundles, the quality of the bread bundles through three levels (the first one in the bakery by the bakery officer, the project officer, and the project assistant and through the volunteers in each distribution point daily, an external monitor from each camp will attend the distribution process, and s/he will monitor the quality and quantity of the bread distributed. Each level of the monitoring process, including the external monitor, will be reported daily, contained signed papers, and reported to the Turkey-based project manager to match all it together. 
A card with a serial number that matches with the SKT database received by hand with the same beneficiary will be distributed for each family monthly.

COVID-19 prevention measures recommended by the FSL cluster will be taken into consideration while implementing the project activities. 

SKT has developed an integrated MEAL and Risk Management plans. PSEA reporting and BNF feedback system are active and functional.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Food Security and Emergency Nutrition response to the most vulnerable conflict-affected IDPs in Al Bab, Aghtrin, Jarablus and Ghandorah sub-districts</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is supporting the food security intervention through distribution of free bread to the IDPs HH in Al-Bab, Aghtrin, Jarablus, and Ghandorah sub-districts, with Nutrition-sensitive response to enhance the food security and nutrition.
The project aims to support 8,524 IDP households (42,924 individuals: 8,256 men, 9,399 women, 13,279 boys, 11,990 girls) in 18 camps in Al-Bab, Aghtrin, Jarablus and Ghandorah sub-districts in Aleppo governorate with free bread distribution in an average of 1 bundle with 800-gram weight for families with 5 members and fewer and 2 bundles with 800-gram weight for families with more than 5 members per day for continuous 140 days over 5.5 months.
To achieve that, BINAA will contract with 4 bakeries from the surrounded area and will provide them with wheat flour and operational costs to prepare the daily needed quantities of bread in order to be distributed to the targeted camps over 27 distribution points.
The distribution will be under the supervision of BINAA field staff (Males and females) and support from the representatives from the local communities.
The project was designed as a continuation to provide free bread distribution to the targeted families who were receiving support through a previous project funded by OCHA until the beginning of April 2021. this was according to the analyses of the needs&#x2019; assessment and FGDs conducted by Binaa which shows the continuity of the need. (refer to Attachment 01-02-04).
BINAA field team will conduct verification visits to 100% of the 18 camp&apos;s residents to add the new arrivals and exclude who left the camps, and this verification will be conducted on monthly basis to ensure the exact number of families and provide them with the assistance.
Binaa will start early procurement in order to fill the gap of stop provision of assistance early in the project period, so Binaa can start the bread provision on time, however, the all the contracting will be after signing the agreement.
BINAA will conduct awareness campaign on the best practices towards COVID-19, mechanisms for reporting violations (GBV and SEA), and access to service, health, nutrition and protection centers.
the campaign will conduct through expert team from the protection staff, (majority of the staff will be women) to cover youth, women, elderly and PWD.
Through the project Binaa will formulate 8 Nutrition Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) to support 46 location in Al-Bab, Jarablus, and Ghandorah Sub-District (Attachment 27), whilst BINAA is already operating 1 RRT in Aghtirin Sub-District since February 2021 supported by UNICEF to the end of December 2021. Hence, the maximized impact of Nutrition Activities with the FSL interventions will be expanded to reach 11 camps in Aghtrin during the project.
The RRTs will reach 13,506 families of the newly IDPs.
The RRTs will Provide the Nutrition Services of integrated CMAM, IYCF, IMCI with adaptations COVID-19 to reach 5,363 PLWs, and 14,392 CU5.
In addition to supporting the engagement of 18% of the targeted families in the FSL program at the food distribution points with scaled-up IYCF-E, WaSH, and Health integrated awareness-raising sessions (1070 families/5280 individuals).
BINAA field team will take all preventing precautions from COVID-19 during the implementation as per the recommendation of Nutrition Cluster, UNICEF, COVID-19 Taskforce, and WHO
Monitoring and Evaluation activities will be conducted throughout the project which will include: Distribution Monitoring, Verification visits, and PDM.
5 camps out of the 18 were not coded by CCCM cluster, so we started the registration process, and the related email is attached, attachment 05.</narrative>

A-	FS activities:
1-	training 300 female-headed households:
- Theoretical part include (food processing, HACCP, business management, marketing) one month
- Practical part include topics on food producing (12 weeks)
2- Distributing 300 food processing tools-vouchers with value 120 $ per woman.
Those assets can be used sustainably in future small projects by women. 
3- Distributing 300 raw materials-vouchers with value 200 $ per woman divided on 4 rounds/months. 
these vouchers will be used to produce food came from vegetables, fruits, or milk.
That small grant aims to encourage women to start their small business projects. 
4- Establishing women groups and building their capacity to empower them.  
5- Distributing cash vouchers with value 60$ (4 rounds to 536 households)
we will target families having children with SAM and high vulnerability score
B- Nutrition Activities
1- CMAM amp IYCF programs:
- Screening, treatment, referral and follow up children 6-59, PLWs for acute malnutrition 
- Distribute micronutrients and nutrition supplementation for preventing anemia and malnutrition among children and PLWs
- Disseminate messages on IYCF-E recommended feeding practices
- Support health/nutrition education and promotion through IEC materials in line with cluster recommendations during COVID19

This intervention will be integrated with other services (health, Wash and Child protection) according to RRTs ToR
This project will be managed and run with full restriction to COVID-19 protection measures, for exam the beneficiaries using the checklist agreed by health cluster task force and measurement the fever to identify the suspected cases of COVID-19 and to inform the EWARN team about the suspected cases.
IHR will implement all FSL activities in all 15 communities. and IHR will implement nutrition services in Afrin district. while AFAQ will implement nutrition activities in remain areas.
The added value of the partnership between IHR and AFAQ, that IHR has good experience in women vocational training and cash vouchers activities. Also, having strong access to Afrin district where the gap is in both sectors. while AFAQ has strong and proven capacity in nutrition programs and strong presence in Idlib.
All the nutrition staff to be contracted will be selected according to a mandatory selection criteria which is the presence of previous experience in implementing similar programs (IYCF &#x2013; CMAM). Then, AFAQ core team will conduct refreshing training related to the Nutrition program (IYCF-E and CMAM) for all field technical staff. Taking into consideration, the project duration is 12 months and service delivery duration is 11 months which gives us one month of preparation to recruit the teams and conducting the training. As well as AFAQ will provide coaching and on job training for the contracted teams during the services delivery.
The complementarity fund available for this project will include nutrition supplies covered by UNICEF and nutrition refreshing training covered by AFAQ. BoQ attached for the nutrition supplies and training plan.
This project will synergize the impact for both programs. Because We will coordinate all of our humanitarian interventions with the relevant clusters as well as the humanitarian actors in order to avoid overlapping and to provide life-saving and sustainable services for the vulnerable population including IDPs and people with special needs including disabilities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cash Based Emergency Assistance and Livelihoods in Afrin and A&#x2019;zaz</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The  main goal of the proposed project is to deliver immediate humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable IDP people in camps and member of host communities (HC) in Afrin complemented with a livelihoods activity to improve the resilience of 50 households through small grants. It addresses the overarching aim &#x201C;to ensure effective use of SCHF resources and inherent added value to achieve maximum impact through provision of humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people, while ensuring cost efficiency and closer integration of interventions.&#x201D; Therefore, WHH chose the most cost efficient modalities, to reach as many people as possible. The project is in line with the strategic objectives ASO 2 &#x201C;Life-saving humanitarian assistance and protection to the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on underserved areas with high severity of needs.&#x201D; and ASO3: &#x201C;Enhance resilience of affected communities through provision of livelihood opportunities.&#x201D; The project addresses the clusters FSL, WASH and Early Recovery in target areas Afrin (FSL, WASH, ER) and A&#x2019;zaz (A&#x2019;zaz) und the locations Bablit, Baee, Jandairis, Kawkabeh, Sharan, Suran, and Zahrat Elhayat. 
The project intends to integrate livelihood, food security and wash using cash as a modality. In North-West Syria (NWS), the price of basic food commodities remains volatile and is subject to speculation. Disruptive events, specifically displacement and COVID-19 have harmful and immediate consequences on the households&#x2019; economy and may result in reduced consumption and exclusion, requiring the adoption of a framework of priorities and actions that are focused on livelihoods. Proposed intervention has 2 components:(1) distribution of cash to internally displaced persons(IDPs) in camps and vulnerable HC members to cover their urgent lifesaving needs (2) Small grants for 50 women to improve their resilience towards external shocks through a sustainable livelihood. 
The primary objective of the activity is to ensure that vulnerable families have access to food and WASH items to fulfill the immediate needs. Cash will be provided through a money transfer agent following procedures agreed in SoPs including C19 preventive measures. Value of cash transfers will be $90 per HH for 8 months, following cluster recommendations. The activity will be implemented in/off camps in Afrin, Jandairis, Sharan sub-districts and Suran Sub-district as well. The activities proposed are aligned with ASO2 (FSL) and ASO3 (WASH) of this standard allocation. 
Complementary to the above proposed component, WHH aims at improving the resilience of 50 women through the provision of small business grants. Each grant will be worth 900 USD and enable the beneficiaries to start her own small business. Potential areas of business are textile, handcrafts, livestock, agriculture, and others. The women will receive a training that educates the beneficiaries in (a) basic profit/loss accounting and (b) marketing. WHH will further assist with market analysis. To avoid that the grant is used for ineligible own-consumption purposes, the grants will be provided in two tranches. After completing the first phase of the activity, the grantees will receive the second tranche. Moreover, the women will be assisted for eight months with cash vouchers in line with the activity introduced above. The activity proposed is aligned with ASO3 (WASH CVA) of this standard allocation. 
The following cluster specific objectives will be addressed: 

ASO 2: FSL: Scale-up efforts to sustain minimum food consumption needs of the most vulnerable IDPs 
ASO 3: 1 ERL: Integrated sectoral response for livelihoods creation 2 WASH: Cash-based programming to enhance access to WASH supplies and services</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of life-saving Education and Health assistance to the most affected population in NW Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shafak is proposing to implement an integrated health and education intervention, that aims at ensuring the continuity of essential health and education services in NWS through promoting equitable access and quality of education and health services for people and school children. An integrated approach will be ensured through linking the targeted beneficiaries from both components for instance, supported children with education will be served and/or referred as necessary to the targeted health facilities, and will be supported with awareness-raising on key health messages including hygiene issues and COVID-19. Furthermore, this action will be complemented with other health, nutrition, education, and protection assistance services provided by Shafak and other actors operating in the same areas. 

The proposed intervention will target 61,303 people (22,164 IDPs, and 39,139 HC) including  11,846 men, 17,577 women, 15,908 boys, 15,972 girls, of them 1,756  people with disabilities. The project will be implemented in the Suran and Aghtrin sub-district of Azaz district in the Aleppo governorate and in Dana, Qourqeena, and Salqin sub-districts in Idleb governorate.

The following services will be provided through this action:

1) Health:

Shafak will continue supporting a comprehensive package of health and outreach services including Primary Health Care (PHC) and community health awareness services in two of the existing facilities, currently supported by GIZ until the end of April 21, in Azaz District. The following facilities will be supported based on Shafak assessment, updated HeRAMS, and recommendation from Aleppo Health Directorate:

Aghtrin PHC center, (HF-Code: B0204077)
Ziadiyah PHC center, (HF-Code: B0204066)

Building on the already established and equipped centers, experienced teams, Shafak will continue providing static health services, outreach, and referrals, focusing on the most vulnerable of women, boys, girls, and PwDs. The services include pediatric, reproductive health (RH), nutrition, management of communicable and non-communicable diseases, providing essential medicines and medical supplies, and will be implemented in line with WHO guidelines (Pillar 9 of COVID 19 Preparedness and Response Plan). 

The health services will target 52,922 people including 11,643 men, 17,465 women, 11,642 boys, and 12,172 girls.

2) Education:

Shafak will provide safe equitable access to 4 non-formal and 12 formal education in Azaz district in the same locations targeted under health intervention, and in Harim district. The main activities are as follows:

1. Non-Formal Education services in four learning centers in Harim district through classroom learning modality (with plan B to resort to distance learning modality, based on developments of COVID 19). These No-formal catch-up classes will run in one cycle in summer to allow the transition to formal education, using the Syrian Interim Government (SIG) curriculum.

2. Formal education services in 12 schools in Harim and Azaz districts at the beginning of the school year 2021/2022 through physical classroom attendance modality. 

3. Psycho-social Support (PSS) sessions for school children using (I-DEAL) curriculum in formal and non-formal settings endorsed by UNICEF and CP sub-cluster. 

4. Establishing Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs).

5. Light maintenance and improvement of learning spaces while considering gender-sensitive and disability-friendly WASH facilities.

6. Teacher&#x2019;s Professional Development delivered to 256 teachers (154 male, 102 female) on EiE, PSEA, and PSS, along with providing monthly incentives to education personnel.

The education activities will target 9,734 crisis-affected children (5,197 boys and 4,537 girls) including CwDs along with 403 education personnel (260 men, 143 women).  

The Integrated approach has been detailed in the Coordination and Complementarity Section due to characters count limit.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting the Provision of Life-Saving and Life-Sustaining Healthcare Services for the Conflict Affected Population in Need Within Harim District.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the SCHF 2021 SA1 allocation- ASO2 objective (To provide Life-saving humanitarian assistance and protection to the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on underserved areas with high severity of needs) and in response to the demonstrated needs and gaps in health service provision for the conflict- affected population within Harim district, Human Appeal Turkey (HAT) proposes to support and sustain the functionality of two healthcare facilities in the district for a duration of 12 months, namely:

 &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; maternity hospital in Sarmada/ Dana sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: G0703086).
 Human Appeal Mobile Clinic in Sarmada IDPs camps/ Dana sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: B0200196).

The above facilities will continue providing primary and secondary healthcare services for around 79,560 people in need within their catchment area as follows:
 RH outpatient consultations in both facilities. 
 Pediatric outpatient consultations in both facilities.
 General medicine outpatient consultations in HAT MC.
 Community health awareness services in both facilities
 Provision of essential medicines in both facilities.
 Referral capacity in both facilities.
 CEmONC services, laboratory services, inpatient healthcare for the women of reproductive age and newborns in Iman hospital.

Also, Iman hospital serves as an operation station for 2 vaccination teams operated by HAT and another 2 teams by ACU. Furthermore, IYCF-E and CMAM services are being provided through the hospital as well.

The proposed facilities are operating in Dana sub-district that is classified by the allocation paper among the areas of highest humanitarian severity scores. Also, and as per the HNAP report, more than 77% of Dana inhabitants are IDPs who in turn are among the most vulnerable individuals that need humanitarian assistance (This is confirmed by the previous caseloads at both facilities as 93% of beneficiaries served through Iman hospital and almost 100% of those served through the mobile clinic were IDPs). Furthermore, the healthcare services planned to be provided at both facilities mainly target women of reproductive age, children under 18 as well as elderly individuals that are all considered among the most vulnerable population groups.

Besides referring to the health cluster/ Turkey hub dashboard health facilities map, and for the purpose of ensuring coordinated and non-duplicating intervention, HAT, during the design phase, was very keen to coordinate and communicate with the partners and coordination bodies relevant to project including the health cluster, Idleb health directorate, SRH TWG, and Sham foundation that is operating a pediatric specialized hospital in Sarmada, the same community where &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital is based.

In addition to the above service package, and to ensure integration of COVID-19 related preparedness and response measure, HAT proposes to maintain the operations at the COVID-19 triage station at Iman hospital for the whole project period. This will help the facility to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission and infection among the staff and the beneficiaries. 

In order to promote the cost efficiency of SCHF matched funds, HAT will provide co-funding of around 175,000 USD to support the provision of all medicines, medical and lab supplies, the majority of project support staff remuneration costs needed for ensuring the smooth implementation of the proposed activities and provision of the planned healthcare services. Accordingly, the cost per medical procedure matched to this application will be around 7.76 USD (Or 9.96 USD considering HA co-funding), where both values are considered to be highly efficient against the average cost of around 10-12 USD across NW- Syria.</narrative>

With a total of 21,592 confirmed cases (of them 1,346 are active cases) and 1157 confirmed cases in Jabal Samaan district (as of 14 April 2021, EWAR/ACU), SAMS will support Al Amal specialized facility in northwest Syria, Jebel Saman district of Aleppo (HeRAMS code: B0200097), for treating and isolating the severe and critically ill patients. The hospital has been functioning as a hospital-based isolation unit (HBIU) since October 2020, and treated until March 2021, 577 patients (60% Male, 40% Female) and is still receiving such cases now (The most affected age groups are patients over 60 years (approximately 60%), whereas the affected patients under 18 years were 2%, and the other affected age groups were 38%).

 Al Amal hosts the highest number of those cases according to the daily update from the Health Information System team (HIS). It is the only HBIU in Jabal Samaan District, an easily accessible facility, and serves around 15 communities in the Jebel Saman district in Aleppo governorate, in addition to one community in Dana sub-district in Idleb governorate, with a total catchment population amounts to 152,154 persons (54,853 IDPs), who may benefit from its services. The isolation hospital is divided into 3 departments as follow:
ICU Department: 30 ICU beds, provides care to critically severe COVID-19 patients, the department is equipped with 30 monitors, 30 ventilators, oxygen output for each bed. 
IPD Department: 40 beds, includes patient assessment, monitoring, routine lab investigation, x-ray, and supportive therapy and treatment. 

The hospital is well equipped with all the needed equipment including Ultrasound cardiac, X-Ray, ECG machine, Video laryngoscopes, incinerator, and oxygen generator.
Also, the hospital has 10 additional monitors in the hospital as we already planning to activate an Intermediate Intensive care unit.

As for the staff, Al Amal hospital has 16 doctors (15 internists and 1 on-call intensivist) in addition to 30 ICU technicians working in the ICU department, 24 nurses, 15 IPC workers, and many other medical and non-medical staff.

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project seeks to strengthen the referral system and the referral data management unit (RDMU) especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and it is a part of the response to the increased needs of conflict-affected people in NWS including the hosts and IDPs who suffer from bad situation related to health and economy and, to support the overall dire humanitarian situation in the region, which contributes to saving lives and reducing the proportion of morbidities.
The prioritized need in this regard is to sustain the functionality of the referral system through the provision of the fuel for 60 ambulances within the central referral system in northern Syria as well as enhancing the referral data management unit (RDMU) as a main unit in the Health Information System (HIS) to ensure the sustainability and quality of health services, as follows:
-	Securing the fuel for 60 ambulances for emergency cases and to operate 4 cold cases vehicles to transfer patients who need non-emergency medical consultations or referred between the HFs across different levels of healthcare for further medical investigations or treatment. Under the referral component, capacity building for the referral focal points of 75 HFs will be done to include them in the central referral system&apos;s direct coordination and supervision mechanism. Where the central referral network will coordinate referrals through 60 ambulances and 4 cars to transport cold cases between 75 health facilities distributed in Idlib, Hama, and Aleppo governorates at a rate of 3,600 referrals per month.
-	Supporting and expanding the Referral Data Management Unit (RDMU) of the Central Health Information System specialized in collecting, processing, and analyzing referral system data. This will be in coordination with the WHO three networks: Harim, Afrin, and Northern Aleppo. The data of 24,000 referred cases from 65 different health facilities will be reported to the RDMU within HIS during the proposed period of the project.

The total number of beneficiaries from this project will be 67,758, as follows:
- # of referred patients by the ambulances and the cold-case vehicles: 43,200
- # of referral focal points trained on referral SoPs: 250
- # of RDMU staff: 8
- # of referred patients whose data have been reported to the RDMU through the 65 hospitals: 24,000
- # of NGOs staff attended RDMU workshops: 300

Please find the following attached annexes:
-	Annex 1- Referral System: Includes the ambulances&apos; positioning points of the referral system.
-	Annex 2- HFs report to RDMU</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of specialized health services to vulnerable conflict-affected populations in Idleb and Aleppo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed 12-month project will strengthen access to lifesaving and life-sustaining essential health services and COVID-19 response in northern Aleppo and northern Idlib, in line with HRP 2021 priorities and AS02. Through targeted health and psychosocial support intervention, it will focus on service provision for most vulnerable groups who have limited access to regular services.

The project addresses needs and critical gaps in locations where a lack of funding (and the pull out of some actors) currently threatens the disruption of essential health services. The project will target 3 locations: In Afrin Jandaires (Jandairis PHC 3!B0203069 and Jelmeh (DDD Jalma comprehensive PHC!B0203087) and in Idleb Al Jolan (Aljolan camp PHCC/ Aljolan Camp!G0703048). In March 2021, Dana and Jandairies sub-districts received among the highest IDPs to both camps and communities, and residents have reported considerable needs accessing health services (March 2021 HNAP Mobility and Needs Monitoring). Communities in these areas face greater health burdens due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with 22,300 confirmed cases as of 18 May 2021 and the arrival of the UK variant of COVID-19 in Afrin, and likely in Idleb. The project will continue provision of specialized health and Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) services in each of the targeted areas, scaling up activities supported under SCHF SA2 2019 and SA1 2020, reaching a total catchment population of 93,047 in and out of camps and host community members (indirect beneficiaries).

Doctors of the World (Turkish acronym DDD) clinics have been responding to the health needs of IDPs and residents in Dana sub-district since 2012 and in Afrin since 2018. DDD is one of the largest providers of health care to NWS with 17 HF (12 directly run by DDD and five through partners). Its strong links with the local community have led DDD to develop the proposed project, responding to priorities and needs identified by the community itself. This project will support emergency preparedness steps to ensure appropriate health service coverage and capacity to increase service availability in case of massive IDP arrival. The project has also been designed in close coordination with the Health Cluster, COVID-19 Taskforce, MHPSS Working Group and humanitarian actors in the area to ensure that integrated and relevant services are provided to the targeted population. 

As highlighted by assessments conducted by field teams and as per evidence presented by the Health Cluster, health needs across Jandaires and Dana sub-district remain high and demand for services continue to increase with continuous arrival of new IDPs. DDD is a key health service provider in Jandaires and Dana providing comprehensive PHC services, Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) and MHPSS through fixed clinics in Jandaires PHC, Jelmeh PHC, and Al Jolan Camp. Support of these facilities in 2021 is essential to maintain availability of services to returning patients and people depending on the services, and to respond to the health needs of new IDPs arriving in the areas served by the clinics. Moreover, adaptation of services to respond to the specific needs of the most vulnerable groups severely impacted by hostilities and displacement is essential. 

The target population includes conflict-affected children under 12 years old, high risk pregnant women, older people, people with disabilities, people living with chronic conditions and other vulnerable groups with limited access to health care. Beneficiaries are consulted throughout the project cycle to ensure services are tailored to support outreach to these groups through community health workers and FCRMs designed to facilitate feedback from diverse male and female beneficiaries to inform any changes in implementation to better ensure their inclusion in DDD health services. A total of 40,906 individuals are expected to directly benefit from this intervention (direct beneficiaries).</narrative>

SEMA support will ensure the provision and continuation of integrated health, nutrition, and protection package services.
In recognition of the risks and urgent needs associated outbreak of COVID-19 in NW Syria, SEMA will provide coordinated assistance to conflict-affected communities, alongside focusing on infection prevention and control through different measures taken for health staff and patients in the health facilities. Triage spaces are already established in front of the identified health facilities. Trained staff will screen persons for COVID-19 and detect and refer suspected COVID-19 cases according to the WHO and Taskforce guidelines. Moreover, awareness raising messages will be distributed to the patients and care givers to ensure risk communication and community engagement. 
SEMA will collect health data from the HFs monthly and share it accordingly. All SEMA - targeted HFs are part of the EWARN network and report weekly bulletin to EWARN regularly. 
SEMA will provide the capacity building, and ongoing medical supervision to ensure the target HFs are staffed with qualified medical personnel and enhance compliance with standard treatment protocols.

In addition to existing 14 community networks for disability inclusion, the project will add one more network, and all of them will further progress towards community-based rehabilitation (CBR) mechanism and act as &#x2018;champions&#x2019; on disability inclusion via
-Engage schools to build disability inclusion capacity at education facilities through peer supports and child resilience activities
-Provide training and awareness sessions on inclusion of people with disabilities in communities
-Identify and refer people with disabilities
-Become an agent of advocacy in their communities for rights of people with disabilities
-Plan and conduct community events of their choices
-Conduct accessibility audits in selected camps/IDP sites/schools
Address barriers to socio-economic opportunities and livelihood through customized supports of their choices for the persons with disabilities with case managements, apprenticeship programme and engagement of the private sector. 
-300 beneficiaries and their families among the most vulnerable households will benefit through case management, protection assistance, referrals, and access to socio-economic activities. 
-Engage the private sector on inclusive employment awareness raising and conduct barrier mapping)

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing urgent health needs for the most vulnerable IDPs and host communities in NWS by sustaining access to primary care services through the integrated implementation of EHSP and life-saving secondary and specialized health care services.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will strengthen access to lifesaving and life-sustaining essential health services within COVID-19 response through providing access to integrated primary and secondary health care services to the vulnerable population of northwestern Syria prioritizing the most critical health services. 
This project is designed as a continuation of previously implemented activities for the most vulnerable IDPs and host communities by sustaining access to existing PHC services and COVID-19 secondary (SHC) and critical care services for highly suspected/confirm COVID-19 patients, especially to those with underlying chronic conditions: lung, heart, renal failure, or an immunocompromising condition.
Objective 1: WHO will cover the provision of essential components of the standardized package of Essential Health Service Package (EHSP) through integrated service delivery modality covering preventive and curative health services, psycho-social and mental trauma effects of the crisis providing health care services by continuing of supporting Qah Kidney dialysis center.
Proposed integrated service delivery modality will reduce the fragmentation caused by the vertical programs and will include integration of community health workers (CHWs) into the PHCs level service delivery aiming to ensure continuity of care by maintaining the functionality of the referral network in North Aleppo and providing COVID-19 related activities within the referral service provision within COVID response (supported by IP/Sham Humanitarian Foundation (AHF)) under the pillar #4 based on the health cluster and COVID-19 task force recommendations.
The implementation of EHSP will be supported through implementing partners UDER and AFAQ that already manages operations of selected HFs. Thus, under the technical guidance of WHO IP/UDER will support 4 PHCs located in Sarmada (G0703011), Termini (G0703028), Zarzur (G0704018), and Daret Azza (B0200006), while IP/AFAQ will support 2 PHCs located in Alsahhara (B0200052), Halazon (B0200216), and mobile team in Maaret Tamsrin area (G0700153). 
Regarding integration of most critical health services, WHO will support hemodialysis by covering logistic of supply chain management for securing 4800 dialysis sessions, 3 Hemodialysis machines, and other vital running costs through its IP/AFAQ. As well integration of mental health and psycho-social support will be implemented via introducing educational and informational activities to reach host communities and IDPs by supporting provision of EHSP through early diagnosis of communicable and non-communicable diseases, including breast screening, information for dialysis patients TB treatment COVID-19 vaccination roll out and other IEC on demand.
Objective 2 will cover the critical gap in the provision of SHC services and supporting the operation of Dana hospital (HeRAMS Code G0703007) which is the only COVID-19 designated hospital located in Tal Elkarame community of Harem district at Idlib governorate. Moreover, during the low caseload of COVID-19, the hospital will provide services to patients with a pulmonary disease requiring intensive care. According to the project design, SHC services will be supported through WHO implementing partner - IP/Sham Humanitarian Foundation (AHF).
The hospital will maintain 24/7 COVID-19 specialized care through the operational capacity of 30 beds including 30 ICU beds equipped with 21 ventilators, 30 monitors, 10 CPAPs having a connection to the central oxygen supplies line through 2 central oxygen generators (18 m3 per hour), and backup of 10 oxygen concentrators. Moreover, the 30-hospital ward bed including 20 medical ward beds and beds with monitors, backup oxygen supplier as intermediate care unit to provide care for patient required lower than ICU care but higher the wards.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations in northern Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As the Syrian conflict enters its eleventh year, the population in northwest Syria (NWS) face mounting challenges due to protracted displacement, poor living conditions, restricted economic opportunities, and limited humanitarian access. These conditions have been made worse by the COVID-19 (C-19) pandemic and ongoing financial crises, exacerbating the existing vulnerabilities of affected populations. Affected populations are in high need of necessities including food, shelter, and non-food items (NFIs), particularly as socio-economic conditions continue to worsen. 

To continue the provision of essential life-saving services and efforts to ensure dignified living conditions for the most vulnerable people in NWS, IOM proposes an emergency food, shelter, and non-food items response under this project. To strengthen preparedness and emergency response capacity, IOM will replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) by procuring and distributing 3,950 NFI kits and 3,950 family tents for 19,750 beneficiaries each. IOM will transship items and current RRM partners (GOAL, Violet Organisation, Mercy-USA, Ataa Humanitarian Relief Association, Uluslararas&#x131; &#x130;nsani Yard&#x131;mla&#x15F;ma Derne&#x11F;i (IYD), Muzun for Humanitarian and Development, Bonyan Organization and Syria Relief and Development) will be responsible for distribution, in coordination with clusters. 

In addition, to scale-up efforts to sustain minimum food consumption needs of the most vulnerable IDPs, IOM will distribute monthly unconditional cash (60 USD) to cover the food needs of 4,300 food-insecure families for eight months (34,400 total payments for 21,742 individuals). Building on IOM&#x2019;s current project (16173) with Syria Cross Border Humanitarian Fund (SCHF), this project will improve and sustain access to food for IDPs residing in one planned camp in Maaret Tamsrin subdistrict and ten planned camps (established under CERF funding in 2020): Abraz in Ma`btali subdistrict (Aleppo Governorate) and Burdaqly, Kafr Nabi, Kafr Takharim, Kelly, Koknaya, Mashhad Ruhin, North Sheikh Bahr, Selwa, and South Shekh Bahr, in a Dana, Maaret Tamsrin, Kafr Takharim, Qourqeenasub-districts (Idleb Governorate). IOM is currently providing CCCM support in these IDP sites through a different SCHF funded project (16173), ensuring safety and protection, as well as coordinating the delivery of multi-sectoral assistance.

Further, to respond to urgent and emerging food needs, IOM will provide one-time assistance to 2,000 new IDP households (HH) and/or surrounding areas with IDP HH affected by floods in consultation with FSL cluster. Assistance will be provided both in-kind through &#x2018;ready to eat rations&#x2019; (for 500 HH) and through cash (100 USD for 1,500 HH). Transfer values are based on the Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (SMEB) defined by the Cash Working Group of South East Turkey. The activity is directly linked to the second strategic objective of providing life-saving humanitarian assistance and protection to the most vulnerable people taking into consideration gender and age-specific needs. As such, IOM will ensure beneficiary participation at all stages of the project, involving all gender and age groups (women, men, boys, and girls) as well as community members with specific vulnerabilities such as PWDs. For example, lessons learned from previous programming highlighted beneficiaries&#x2019; preference for all distributions to have separate queues for men and women. This will be ensured under this allocation and monitored by mixed-gender TPM teams. To mitigate Gender-Based Violence (GBV) risks, IOM ensures that information provision and feedback mechanisms are designed to be accessible, effective, and confidential and respond to complaints, regardless of whether corrective measures can immediately be put in place. All Implementing Partners (IPs) named in the proposal are indicative, based on preliminary assessment, pending IOM&#x2019;s internal partner selection processes upon activation of the grant.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will cover 61,239 people, disaggregated as follows:
- 22,051 PLWs
- 39,188 Children under 5 (20,055 girls - 19,133 boys)

15 rapid response teams (RRTs) will provide integrated nutrition, health, and protection life-saving services in the targeted areas and camps (Attached) in 
Idleb gt Ariha gt Mhambal gt Bales / Beftamun / Hila / 
Idleb gt Harimgt Armanaz gt Hafasraja - Kabta - Kuwaro - Um Elriyah
Idleb gt Harimgt Dana gt Kafr Deryan
Idleb gt Harimgt Qourqeena gt Barisha- Kafr Aruq - Qourqeena - Ras Elhisn	
Idleb gt Harimgt Salqin
Idleb gt Jisr-Ash-Shugur gtBadama gt Baksariya - Ein El-Bayda (Badama) - Hanbushiyeh - Kherbet Eljoz- Ramliyeh 
Idleb gt Jisr-Ash-Shugur gtJanudiyeh gtFoz - Zuf / Hamama - Kafr Debbin - Janudiyeh - Maland
Idleb gt Jisr-Ash-Shugur gt Jisr-Ash-Shugur gt Eshtabraq - eyn albarda - Frikeh (Shat-ha) - Kafir (Jisr-Ash-Shugur) - Qaysiyeh - Watba

Each Rapid response team (RRT) will work in specific locations and will cover (pregnant and lactating women and children under 5)
- 1 RRTs in Idleb gt Ariha 
- 9 RRts in Idleb gt Harim
- 5 RRts in Idleb gt Jisr-Ash-Shugur 

These Rapid response teams will work in parallel and in coordination with the available health facilities in the target areas. The RRTs will provide integrated health, nutrition, child protection, and hygiene promotion.

Nurses will screen the children under 5 and refer the ones with dangers signs and medical problems to the available health facilities.

Community Health Workers (CHWs) will assess and screen nutritional status among the children under 5 and distribute nutritional supplies to them where needed. Also, the infant and young child feeding practices in emergencies (IYCF-E) services will be provided to prevent any case of malnutrition by:

- Counseling the PLWs and caregivers of children under 24 months of age and providing messages on IYCF-E recommended practices to mothers who have malnourished children. 
- Distributing micronutrients and nutrition supplies for the PLWs and children.
- Reporting to the cluster any distribution of breast milk substitute.

Midwives will screen pregnant and lactating women and refer the ones with any danger signs or medical problems to the nearest facilities. 

Also, a pre and rapid coordination combined with referrals will be in place if the team notices or identifies any sign of abuse or violence among children under 5 and or mothers. All cases of violence against women and children will be referred to a pre-identified center.

This response will adopt the recommendation of the cluster in COVID-19 context to minimize the risk of infection for staff and beneficiaries through:

- Mercy-USA will apply recommended IPC measures at RRTs sites 
- IYCF-E counseling and messages could be conducted via WhatsApp 

-Dissemination of information on COVID-19 signs, symptoms and IPC measures 
-All other needed measures will apply according to the cluster recommendation 

Also, this project will involve empowering mothers and HH members through training to screen their own children for malnutrition by teaching them how to use color-coded Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) tapes and check for Odema.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the demonstrated nutrition needs on the ground, Human Appeal Turkey (HAT) and Social Development International (SDI) proposes to jointly operate 11 nutrition rapid response teams (RRTs) across North West Syria (NWS) targeting the children under 5 (CU5) and pregnant and lactating women (PLWs) among others of the most vulnerable groups within the areas of priority (As per the nutrition cluster and this allocation paper) with essential life-saving curative and preventative nutrition services as follows:

- HAT: Establishment and operation of 4 RRTs in Dana sub-district for a duration of 11 months (Locations are coordinated with the nutrition cluster).

- SDI: Operation of pre-existing 7 RRTs: 2 in Afrin, 1 in Maaret Tamisrin, 3 in dana, and 1 in Salqin sub-districts for a duration of 12 months.

The project will be implemented in 23 communities across 4 sub- districts (Dana, Maaret Tamisrin, Afrin and Salqin) provide nutrition services for 83546 beneficiaries including (19200 Pregnant and lactating women 44800 children under five years and 19546 other caregivers (men and women)) (79918 IDPs and 3628 HCs) (1800 PWDs).

HAT and SDI will collaborate to promote the ultimate utilization of the pre-existing resources and expertise relevant to the intervention including the use of the trained staff at both organizations and the shared usage of the assembly points, warehouses, OTPs as well as the exchange of relevant technical expertise and measures of access and coordination at the field level. It&#x2019;s imperative to mention that both HAT and SDI will make sure that the above will not result in increased costing of the proposed intervention. On the contrary, having such complementarity measures in place will potentially lead to overall cost effectiveness of the project.

The proposed RRTs are planned to function according to the TORs and SOPs adopted by the nutrition cluster, and they will be providing the following nutrition services:

 Screening 44800 children 6-59 months, and 19200 PLWs, referral and follow up who are malnourished.
 Provide emergency IYCF counseling for 7750 caregivers including PLWs.
 Disseminating messages on IYCF-E recommended feeding practices, for 30.000 caregivers including PLWs.

 Screen, referral CU5 and PLWs with dangers signs and Medical problems.
 Support hygiene promotion and rising WASH awareness by providing Key messages to prevent the risk of COVID 19 transmission and other infections.
 Identify visual signs of abuse/violence against childU5/PLWs during Nutrition screening.
 Capacity building of 60 frontline nutrition services providers on IYCF-E and CMAM programs in the context of COVID-19 and provide continuous technical support for human appeal teams to build their capacity and strengthen their experience in nutrition field work.

As a part to COVID 19 response, the partners are going to apply adjustments of the nutrition activities to mitigate the risk of infection while ensuring continuity of life-saving nutrition services, where they are going to integrate key messages on hygiene and COVID-19 symptoms, and (IPC) measures, implement a simplified protocol for the treatment of acute malnutrition, use a separate MUAC tape for each child and PLW, distribute micronutrients for two months in advance if available, screen and refer suspected COVID-19 cases, applying recommended IPC measures, provide IYCF-E counseling, either at the appropriate distance of 1 meters apart or remotely by phone or video and disseminate IYCF-E messages use platforms such as text messages and WhatsApp videos, posters in public places. 
The partners will train the caregivers of MAM and SAM cases on MUAC and edema screening, referral, recognize signs of deterioration, and give them a mobile or WhatsApp number of the CHW to contact in case the child&#x2019;s condition deteriorates.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing Integrated Emergency Nutrition Services for People in Need in NW Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this project, UOSSM aims to provide life-saving integrated nutrition services by supporting 10 Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) in Al Dana (with 189,523 HCs and 844,187 IDPs) and Maaret Tamsrin (with 73,256 HCs and 220,525 IDPs) sub-districts, targeting PIN Children under five (CU5) and caregivers including pregnant and lactating women (PLWs) and people with disabilities. These areas have 74 camps according to CCCM with 76,033 IDPs. The proposed activities will be for 12 months including 1-month preparation. 
The RRTs are distributed between the targeted communities according to the number of IDPs as follows: 3 RRTs in Deir Hasan, 3 RRTs in Atma, 3 RRTs in Aqrabat, and 1 RRT in Bahouri, Alshiek Baher, and Maaret Tamsrin.
These RRTs will be linked to UOSSM&#x2019;s health facilities in the targeted communities which will receive the referred cases by RRTs. Each RRT is expected to reach 30 beneficiaries (22 CU5 and 8 PLWs) per day, so it is expected to deliver integrated nutrition services to a total of 82,500 (60,500 CU5 and 22,000 PLWs) equal (76,033 IDPs and 6,467 HCs) new beneficiaries and following up beneficiaries. The RRTs will visits each beneficiary multiple times based on the need within the project period.  
RRTs&#x2019; main activities will include:
	Strengthening early case finding, treatment for MAM and SAM cases without complications in case supplies is available from UNICEF. If the supplies are unavailable, SAM and MAM cases will be referred to UOSSM&#x2019;s health facility in the same community. 
	Providing screening, treatment, and follow-up, and referring the complicated malnutrition cases to the nearest hospitals (Sarmada - Al-Sham Humanitarian, Atma - Hand in Hand for Aid and Development, Maaret Tamsrin - Shafak) to ensure the completion of CMAM program cycle.
	Referring beneficiaries with dangerous signs to the health facilities for treatment.
	Providing emergency IYCF counseling for mothers with moderately malnourished children, and micronutrient distribution for preventing anemia and malnutrition among children and PLWs.
	RRTs will support integrated nutrition services with hygiene promotion.
	Screening and referring CU5 and PLWs with signs of abuse/violence to GBV case management and women and girls&#x2019; safe space (WGSS) centers to receive services according to their needs.
According to UNICEF and Nutrition cluster protocols, to enable RRTs to deliver integrated nutrition services with high quality, UOSSM aims to conduct IYCF amp CMAM training during the first quarter. UOSSM also will support the training platform and deliver COVID-19 online training course to RRT&#x2019;s staff in the field of the COVID-19 pandemic, besides, conduct GBV training for all members of RRTs staff.
On the other hand, UOSSM&#x2019;s MampE team developed the monitoring plan where the MampE team monitors implementation of project activities in the field through field visits, conducting beneficiaries satisfaction, controlling services quality, following up the progress of activities, and achieve indicators monthly and quarterly.
Nutrition programmatic adjustments will be implemented in the context of COVID-19 to mitigate the risk of infection while ensuring continuity of life-saving nutrition services. Furthermore, RRTs teams will be provided with PPE during delivering services.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Explosive Ordnance Risk Education, Disposal, and Non-Technical Survey in Northwest Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is consistent with HALO&#x2019;s contribution to the 2021 HRP (ref: HSYR21-PRO-178454-1). It reflects lessons learned from HALO&#x2019;s experience in northwest Syria since 2016 and is in consultation with the Mine Action Sub-Cluster (MASC) and the northwest Syria humanitarian cluster network in Gaziantep.

HALO will deliver a 12 month humanitarian mine action response to support 12,538 beneficiaries through direct implementation and support from an implementing partner (iMFAD). The project includes:

 a) Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE)
 b) EORE Trainer of Trainer (ToT) training
 c) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and
 d) Non-Technical Survey (NTS) 

These activities will be conducted in selected sub-districts across opposition-controlled areas of Idleb and western Aleppo and across Turkish-administered areas of northern Aleppo. HALO will deliver EORE and ToT training in opposition-controlled areas and iMFAD will deliver EOD and NTS in Turkish-administered areas. EORE field staff will be trained to deliver community COVID-19 awareness messaging consistent with WHO guidance.

Explosive Risk Ordnance Education and Train the Trainer Training
One five-person Community Liaison Team (CLT) under HALO will deliver 30-40 minute community-based risk education sessions to children and adults across Idleb, Harim and Jisr-Ash-Shugur districts. Content will be consistent with MASC key messaging. The CLT will also deliver training to Community Focal Points (CFPs) and NGO Focal Points across all humanitarian sectors to improve the integration and reach of risk education messaging. The total beneficiary target is 11,960 direct beneficiaries (11,730 EORE beneficiaries and 230 CFPs and NGO Focal Points). Beneficiary calculations are at Annex C.

Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Non-Technical Survey
One five-person EOD/NTS team under iMFAD will destroy 105 items and complete 15 non-technical survey community reports across 22 communities throughout the duration of the project in the districts of A&#x2019;zaz and Afrin of the Aleppo governorate, averaging one item of explosive ordnance per day. The team will also conduct NTS in explosive ordnance (EO) contaminated communities to assess minefields, cluster munition strike areas, IED fields, and areas densely contaminated with EO to better define these areas in terms of scale, hazard and impact on communities and to enable planning of future activities. The total beneficiary target is 578 direct EOD beneficiaries.

The project will be delivered by HALO field staff from their office in Kelly, Idleb and by iMFAD field staff in A&#x2019;zaz, Aleppo. HALO and iMFAD&#x2019;s offices will coordinate operations from Gaziantep and field staff will be supported directly by HALO staff in Amman and iMFAD staff in Balikesir. Lessons learned from previous projects as well current funding constraints have prompted HALO to restructure both programme and field offices to be leaner, more efficient and cost effective, adapting the number of staff to more effectively match the needs of the project size, requirements and the current funding limitations. The project comprises staff 20 funded at 100% (HALO: 9 iMFAD, 11) &#x2013; all in Northwest Syria and 15 funded under shared arrangements (HALO: 10, iMFAD: 5). 24 of 35 staff are in Northwest Syria. This shared funding is principally through private unrestricted donations to HALO to be allocated to the project. The project organogram is at Annex F.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-saving protection mitigation and prevention support for unaccompanied and separated children and families vulnerable to separation</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this project, SARD intends to support a number of unaccompanied and separated children and families vulnerable to separation through continuation and extension of its specialized and unspecialized protection services which specifically target sensitive child protection issues such as family separation, early child marriage, child labor and recruitment to military services. Through its emergency centres/ Child-Friendly Spaces (CFS) in A&#x2019;zaz, SARD provides unaccompanied and separated children with critical life-saving protection services including shelter, emergency and accelerated learning support and PSS, and foster placement. Outside the centres, through its referral system in coordination with the Protection cluster, SARD&#x2019;s Mobile Case Management team identifies child protection cases and renders or refers specialized and unspecialized protection services. 
The project is innovative and is an alternative approach of child protection providing multi-sectoral integrated response to the UASC in the emergency shelter and providing alternative care with particular effort to place the UASC in foster families. Foster families and other families vulnerable to child separation are accompanied throughout the project with provision of dedicated services to favour family placement and prevent family separation
During the project, the following will be implemented :
- 1 emergency shelters  will be running and equipped to host UASC in emergency situation. In the center, all services are provided to the UASC : each child will receive a full kit (1 in summer and 1 in winter) that includes clothes, shoes, hygiene material and products, Each child is assigned a dedicated space for sheltering him ensuring safety and security is provided 24/7. In the center, the UASC will be also provided with all the necessary food (special dietary is provided depending on the child needs, age and conditions), necessary environmental hygiene (hair cut, disinfection of the premises, Covid 19 prevention, basic environmental health care. The innovation being the project will provide all the services, integrated and multi-sectoral, to ensure the aulity of the delivery and the best accountability to the children benefiting the project.
- provision of protection services to children and foster families or families vulnerable to separation, through mobile team visit and assessments. This action will aim at providing all necessary emergency support to families to keep the children in the household securing access to basic needs. As such, SARD will refer the family in emergency needs to other project implemented by SARD with provision of basic needs and even livelihood/income generating opportunities to secure access to income to cover emergency basic needs (under other donors). These activities are implemented by 2 mobile teams (of 4 persons), 1 child protection mobile team in Azaz   looking at UASC needs in each location and 1 PSS mobile team (of 4 persons) covering providing all the PSS supports and requirement to both UASC and parenting program as well.
- Parenting Program: SARD facilitates a parenting program to train caregivers on Child Protection, PSS and dealing with their children&#x2019;s behavior. 
Separated and Unaccompanied children boys and girls shall be identified and registered in child protection information management system and their parents traced for reunification. Reflecting on the current situation in northwest Syria, there are many cases of separated and unaccompanied children identified but their families not yet traced, SARD will work closely with the care givers to ensure that conflict affected children boys and girls are protected from abuse, violence, and exploitation through organising meeting with care givers to discuss the child protection issues in the communities to come up with best ways to protect the affected children.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An integrated and complementary approach to support the most vulnerable persons with improved access to food security and WASH services.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under WASH amp FSL, Violet (VO) is proposing a complementary, integrated, amp multisectoral 10 months project to address WASH amp FSL needs of the most vulnerable. The project was designed based on the need assessment amp clusters guidance with the following activities:

- FSL (SO2)
VO will provide lifesaving assistance by the blanket distribution of regular cash for food (60 $ / HH $50 amp the value of  $10 in the local currency preferred by recipients) for 783 food-insecure IDPs HHs (3915 Ind) inhabiting Mashhad Rouhin camps in Dana Sub-district over 8 rounds to improve their access to diversified amp fresh food amp increase their purchasing power without being affected by the devaluation of the local currency. The aim is to contribute to sustaining minimum food consumption needs of the vulnerable IDPs. By doing so, access to diverse foods will also strengthen their immune system amp mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 on their socio-economic. Besides cash, VO will distribute soap kits (750 G of soap/HH) in accordance with WASH cluster recommendation) to improve BNFs access to COVID-19 prevention means. Cash modality is selected to provide flexibility for BNFs to buy their needs, but also to provide assistance in a dignified way. To avoid harm, VO confirmed the viability of the local market to meet the increased demand. However, VO will conduct RNA prior to distributions to verify the availability amp accessibility to the functioning markets. The cash value was designed to cover approx. 70% of the daily intake (1550 Kcal/ person/ day) as per the FSL guidance. It is reflective of 70% of the SMEB food-only proxy basket. Cash for food will complement SR - WASH activities in the targeted camps

- WASH (SO1, SO2)
The component aims to address the WASH needs of both IDPs amp HC who are living in both settings (in-camp amp off-camp) through the provision of comprehensive WASH services by the WASH activities below to be implemented in the camps in Mashhad Rouhin amp Bab El Hawa locations:
1.Provision of 35 liters of drinking amp chlorinated water for 15,470 BNFs inhabiting 5 IDPs camps for 3 months. The water quality will be insured by conducting the water tests by VO&apos;s monitors. Moreover, VO will coordinate with ACU to ensure the quality of the water sources
2.Rehabilitation of boreholes, water stations, amp water networks inside the targeted camps. The water systems will be equipped with PV Solar energy systems to minimize the water system operating costs amp to ensure the sustainability amp long-term impact of the project.
3. Distribution of Hygiene kits to the IDPs inhabiting the camps to improve the BNFs access to most essential hygiene supplies. Moreover, VO will implement campaigns to disseminate awareness messages related to COVID-19 (RCCE), the importance of preventive measures, amp hygiene promotion.
4.Solid waste management amp desludging septic tanks  in 4 camps amp for 7 months in Al Emam Camp while Shafak covers its needs till end of June
WASH activities will complement White Hands, amp PIN&apos;s GFA in part of the target camps
On the other hand, VO is planning to conduct the necessary rehabilitation of the water system in Al Abzimo Community to improve the IDPs amp HC in Abzimo in western Aleppo access to clean water, but also to reduce required water trucking amp lack of access to clean amp safe drinking water. To ensure the intervention impact amp sustainability, VO will equip the water station with PV Solar Power system to minimize the operating costs. Furthermore, VO will support the community to establish the Tariff system amp re-activate the cost recovery mechanism to ensure an effective response

During Project Implementation, VO will ensure COVID-19 preventive measures are applied to avoid exposing the communities to harm
