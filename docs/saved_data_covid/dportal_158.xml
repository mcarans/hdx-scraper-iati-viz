  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention will contribute to the Health and Nutrition cluster&apos;s objective 3: &#x201C;In coordination with Protection and Education Cluster, providing MHPSS to those traumatized by the ongoing crisis in the oPt (HRP SO2)&#x201D;, through increasing the capacities of primary health care clinics (PHCCs) to respond to the MHPSS basic needs with an integrated approach of mental health in essential primary health care (PHC) services. Taking into consideration all efforts made to this field in previous projects conducted by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and World Health Organization (WHO), M&#xE9;decins du Monde (MdM) is interested in strengthening the capacity building through training and supervision of healthcare providers in general primary care services within the formal health system. In the proposed intervention MdM will focus on the southern governorates (Rafah and Kahn Younis) of the Gaza Strip, by ensuring the proper integration of Mental Health and Psycho-social services (MHPSS) using the mhGAP approach, as recognized by MoH and WHO as the national MH integration protocol. The objective of MdM intervention is to strengthen the capacity of non-specialist healthcare providers at the PHC level, to identify, assess, and provide care to people with priority Mental, Neurological, and Substance Use (MNS) related conditions, with a focus on those with additional vulnerability, such as GBV survivors, People with Disabilities, Non-communicable diseases, and crisis and conflict.
Following the last escalation of violence and its negative impact on the Gaza population&apos;s mental health wellbeing, PHC patients and visitors will also benefit from mental health awareness sessions to reinforce their resilience, their understanding of mental health-related topics and so the stigma. Also, even though Gaza might consider itself as out of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, this intervention will take into consideration all needed precaution measures to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission among the communities and medical staff targeted. All MdM proposed interventions have been already coordinated with MoH, Health and Nutrition clusters, as well as WHO, in order to ensure the effectiveness, the efficiency of the intervention and to avoid any duplication or overlapping.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Specialized Mental Health Services to Boys, Girls, Women And Men with and without Disabilities who Affected by the Ongoing Crises In The Gaza Strip</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims at contributing to alleviate the effects of the recent round of hostilities affected the population of the Gaza strip compounded with the COVID-19 crisis, through the delivery of specialized mental health services to the most vulnerable women, men, girls and boys with and without disabilities. The project comes as an emergency response to the consequences of last crises. It enhances also the link between services offered by GCMHP and other services provided by other service providers working under the umbrella of health and protection clusters. The project interventions will include the following:
1. Provision of Psychological First Aid (PFA) services to 11,286 affected people, including children and adults via five mobile PFA teams who will conduct hospital/home visits to patients and other affected people, and will detect and refer cases in need to specialized mental health services. Coordination with MoH and MoSD will be continued in reaching the beneficiaries&#x2019; lists. Through the PFA home visits, 1700 PFA kits will be distributed to children affected by the violent conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic according to a specific selection criterion that considers the vulnerability and socioeconomic conditions of the children.
2. Provision of specialized mental health services to 800 persons including 200 children (boys and girls) and 600 adults (women and men)) who have displayed symptoms of severe psychosocial distress. By using the existing referral system, those cases will be detected and referred by the five PFA teams of psychologists, case managers and psychosocial support staff working in Child Protection and Health clusters and MHPSS networks. The clinical services will be provided by specialized multi-disciplinary teams including psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, social workers, and rehabilitation specialists at GCMHP three community centers located in Gaza city, Deir El Balah and Khan Younis. Therapy plans include psychotherapy, play therapy, medication, family counseling, and home visits.
3. Building the capacities of 200 health workers including doctors, nurses, ambulance officers etc., by providing them with group supportive supervision and stress management sessions. These sessions will contribute to avoid secondary trauma among medical workers and to alleviate occupational exhaustion resulting from work and life conditions and pressures, and preserves the motivation of the supervisee to work, which subsequently leads to increased levels of job satisfaction.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of health and protection services for vulnerable women and girls impacted by the escalation of violence in Gaza</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following the ceasefire agreed on Friday 21 May, the grave impact of the hostilities is becoming clear. Some 242 Palestinians were killed, including at least 66 children and 38 women, and at least 1948 people were wounded. At least 3,222 families (over 16,600 people) saw their homes damaged, according to the Ministry of Social Development. The health system in Gaza, already overwhelmed by many years of blockade of Gaza, and by the longstanding COVID-19 pandemic, is significantly overstretched. Nine hospitals were partially damaged and 19 health clinics were damaged in the hostilities, including one that sustained severe damage.

As in other humanitarian crises, women and girls bear much of the brunt of these hostilities, placing their lives, dignity and well-being at risk. There are an estimated 49,500 pregnant women in Gaza. Around 16,500 women will give birth over the next 3 months, and require access to essential healthcare services. Meanwhile, the risk of gender-based violence, including harmful coping mechanisms such as child marriage, often increase during crises, further endangering the lives and well-being of women and girls.

This intervention will support 28,519 women, girls, and young people in Gaza with access to life saving sexual and reproductive health care, gender based violence services, and MHPSS through the following activities.

Health:
1. Procurement of life saving sexual and reproductive health supplies for MOH and key NGOs. The supplies will support an estimated 14,850 pregnant women.
2. Procurement of contraceptives to ensure access to consistent family planning and avoid unintended pregnancies. The contraceptives will support an estimated 8,108 women (and their partners) to avoid unintended pregnancies.
3. Conducting community awareness activities for 3,000 community members on sexual and reproductive health, including where and when to seek health services during pregnancy, and mental health and psychosocial wellbeing for pregnant and lactating women.

Protection (GBV):
1. Providing cash assistance to 1,000 women at risk of GBV, including an estimated 100 women living with disability.

MHPSS (health and protection):
1. Psychological first aid training for 300 service providers and youth volunteers (200 sexual and reproductive healthcare workers and 100 trained youth volunteers).
2. Provision of psychosocial support for adolescents and youth through trained youth volunteers.
3. Conducting psychosocial support interventions through sport for vulnerable young women and girls.

Women, girls, and young people with disability will be included in provision of supplies, PFA training, and MHPSS support.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Inclusive summer recreational activities providing vulnerable children with MHPSS support and Explosive Ordnance Risk Education Awareness Sessions.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HI designed a 3-months action aiming to support vulnerable children affected by May 2021 escalation providing non-formal education services and PSS support through inclusive recreational summer activities and enhance their safety with Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) Awareness sessions 
The proposed intervention is fully aligned with the Third Allocation Strategy May 2021 and the 2021 Humanitarian Needs Overview. It also supports the achievement of 2021 HRP, specifically Objective 2 &#x201C;the basic needs of vulnerable Palestinians living under occupation are met through the provision of quality basic services and improved access to resources, in accordance with the rights of protected persons under IHL&#x201D;.
The project is needs-based designed and tailored on the findings and recommendation of the Flash Appeal of May 2021, Education Cluster including Summer Activities Working Group: Protection Cluster including the Mining Action Working Group (MAWG). It responds to the identified priorities of the Third Reserve Allocation: ensuring that children can access safe and inclusive learning opportunities through the provision of non-formal education services and reducing deaths and injuries caused by Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) and Explosive Ordonnance Disposal (EOD).
The project will implement Inclusive Summer Activities targeting 1,860 boys and girls including 700 children with disabilities in the 5 governorates of the Gaza Strip to support vulnerable children psychologically affected by May 2021 escalation. Caregivers, family, and community members will participate during the open-day session where the participants will present the recreational activities outputs. The action is built on the previous experience of HI in implementing inclusive summer activities for boys and girls with and without disabilities since 2015. In addition, two local implementing partners with extensive experience (more than 20 years) on the provision of community recreational and non-formal education activities and summer activities have been selected: Tamer Institute for Community Education (Tamer) and The Culture and Free Thoughts Association (CFTA). The summer activities will be designed in session of 2 days each, 6 sessions will be implemented in each governorate targeting between 60 to 70 boys and girls each session, in line with the MoE COVID indications. The summer activities will include, sport activities, expressive and creative art activities, cultural and life-skills activities and adolescents led-initiatives. 
CFTA and Tamer facilitators and animators will be trained by HI to develop their skills and knowledge to adapt summer programs activities, materials, and equipment for the use of children with disabilities and ensuring their inclusion.

Within its second outcome HI will conduct a Needs Assessment on EORE to identified risk area, vulnerable target groups and mean of communication setting priorities and support the coordination with other relevant actors (i.e. Demining Working Group members) avoiding duplication and more important exclusion of persons at risk. Explosive Ordnance Risk Education session will be included in the summer activities enhancing children&#x2019;s skills in recognize the risk and apply correct behaviour to increase their safety. Tailored training will be implemented to ensure a child-friendly approach and the application of the Do Not Harm principle considering the sensitivity and level of trauma children are already exposed</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Child Protection and MHPSS responses for girls, boys and  families most affected by the recent escalation of violence in Gaza</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Save the Children is proposing an integrated Child Protection and Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) response targeting girls, boys and caregivers affected by the recent escalation of violence in Gaza. The project will provide mental health and psychosocial support services and child protection case management and referrals to conflict-affected children in all governorates in the Gaza strip.

SC and Maan Development Centre will build on their common experience in addressing mental health, psychosocial and protection needs of children affected by crisis. In line with previous interventions we will keep supporting the Governorate Protection Focal Points and their role in assessing children and family needs, provide them with immediate emotional support, follow up visits and referrals to specialized services as needed. &#x2013; The Focal Points will implement Save the Children&#x2019;s home-based MHPSS model, a structured home-visiting intervention that was initially designed to respond to the needs of children and families affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The model was then adapted to respond to the MHPSS needs of children and caregivers affected by exposure to conflict and other extreme stressors, and it will be further contextualized for implementation in the current response.
Children facing specific protection concerns will be referred to Maan case managers and a comprehensive plan will be developed to address their needs, aligning with international case management guidance, existing inter-agency SOPs for Gaza and the latest guidance on remote case management developed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The intervention will include a tailored response for girls and boys facing gender-based violence in close coordination with specialized actors and civil society. Home visits and group activities will identify children facing specific CP risks and gender considerations, with outreach and identification strategies adapted to reach those who may be &#x2018;invisible&#x2019; in the target communities. The results of the joint CP/MHPSS/GBV assessment planned by SC and War Child Holland will help define these strategies and further tailor project interventions.
Children identified in need of structured psychosocial support will participate in a series of group-based sessions, following SC&#x2019;s Child Resilience Programme approach already trialled successfully in Gaza. The MHPSS sessions will provide additional opportunities for the facilitators to identify the children in need of further support and to refer them if necessary for individual counselling, case management or other support. 
Structured parenting support sessions will assist caregivers in how to protect and support their children, how to understand their behaviour in time of stress and to develop positive parenting skills. Caregivers who participate in the group sessions are mainly those whose children are participating in structured PSS activities. This ensures that those children will receive the needed support at home and encourages a sustainable positive change in family relations.
The project will also support children&#x2019;s summer camps, providing children with space to express themselves and release stress through a range of age and gender appropriate recreational activities, while supporting their mental, physical and emotional well-being. The summer camps will also actively promote gender equality by enabling girls, who are often denied the opportunity, to participate in sports and recreational activities, with a unique and safe space within which to engage in physical activity. 

Finally, we will distribute 672 family recreations kits that are designed to help children have fun, engage in safe activities as a way to release their stress.

The activities proposed in this project are all aligned with the CP/MHPSS sub-cluster scale up plan for the emergency response and agreed in coordination with other relevant CP/MHPSS actors in Gaza.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing an emergency assistance to respond to the shelter and NFI needs of vulnerable households affected by the May 2021 hostilities in Middle Area, Khan Younis and Rafah governorates, Gaza Strip</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to support the most vulnerable households affected by the May 2021 hostilities in the Gaza Strip through the provision of emergency assistance to respond to the shelter and NFI needs. This will be achieved through the provision of cash for partially damaged shelter repair and the distribution of essential NFIs to vulnerable HHs furthermore, a complimentary cash assistance for transitional shelter and one-off reintegration package will be provided to most vulnerable IDPs, as well as the provision of cash for NFIs and/or adaptation works, contributing to reduce hosting and IDPs families&#x2019; vulnerabilities. Throughout the implementation of all activities, COVID-19 prevention measures will be integrated to ensure the safety of beneficiaries and staff. 

Specifically, ACTED and the local implementing partner Unlimited Friends Association for Development, will implement a multi-pronged approach in Middle Area, Khan Younis and Rafah governorates to restore shelter and NFIs standard needs of vulnerable households and IDPs, through the following means: 

-	Conducting a technical assessment to define precise needs for shelter repair on partially damaged shelters and NFIs through the production of detailed Bills of Quantities (BoQs) and their subsequent remedy through clear workplans
-	Providing cash assistance and technical support for shelter rehabilitation and upgrade to the most vulnerable households 
-	Providing in-kind NFIs to the same vulnerable households living in partially damaged houses, where needed
-	Facilitating shelter transitional solutions for IDPs whose shelter is uninhabitable or totally destroyed through the provision of cash for renting or minor shelter repair
-	Providing a one-off cash reintegration package to the IDPs 
-	Providing cash for NFIs and/or improving their living conditions through shelter adaptation works for hosting families and hosted IDPs  
-	Providing on-the-job coaching and mentoring of Community-based Protection Committees (CBPCs).

In total, the project will directly benefit 280 households in the Middle Area, Rafah and Khan Younis governorates, comprising 1,596 individuals and 18 members of CBPCs.  First, 150 households living in partially damaged homes and in need of urgent restoration will benefit from both the provision of restricted cash repair assistance for minor/partial damages (activity 1.1.2) and in-kind NFIs distribution (activity 1.1.3). Secondly, 80 IDPs families whose houses were totally destroyed and whose houses were uninhabitable will benefit from both the cash assistance for transitional shelter solution (activity 1.1.4) and the provision of a cash one-off reintegration package (1.1.5). In addition, 50 hosted families (IDPs families living in hosting families) and hosting families will benefit from the provision of cash for NFIs and/or improve their living condition (activity 1.1.6). Finally, 18 CBPC members (of 3 CBPCs) will be monitored and receive on-the-job coaching (activity 1.1.7).

The project will be supported by the mainstreaming of an Integrated Protection Approach (IPA), with a specific focus on the most vulnerable groups, including women, girls, boys, the disabled, and the elderly. Gender principles will be mainstreamed throughout the entire action and CBPCs will be refreshed about referral mechanisms of protection cases such as gender-based violence (GBV) with a particular focus given to women and children. Finally, Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) will be core to the proposed Action by giving account to, taking account of, and being held to account by affected populations. The proposed intervention is in line with the Shelter cluster&#x2019;s objective 1,3 and 4, and has been developed and will be implemented in coordination with the Shelter Cluster, the Ministry of Social Development (MoSD) and other shelter partners, including PUI, NRC and MAAN.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Immediate shelter solutions to the conflict-affected people in North Gaza Strip</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project responds to the 2nd and 3rd Shelter/NFIs cluster objectives on 27 May 2021 &quot;Undertaking urgent repair of uninhabitable homes to reduce the displacement caseload, relieve pressure on the growing need for homes and reduce risks for host and hosted families&quot;, and: &quot;Undertaking selective repair for partially damaged homes and adaptation interventions for the most vulnerable groups, including female head-of-household, elderly, and PWDs&quot; (both objectives are linked to HRP SO2). 

The project&apos;s overall objective is to ensure that 822 of the most conflict-affected and vulnerable people (144 HHs) are timely supported with urgent shelter repairs that mitigate harm and enhance their coping capacity includes: 
1) Restricted cash for urgent repair assistance and restoration of 50 severely damaged homes
2) Restricted cash repair assistance for 94 partially damaged homes 
The targeted households under this fund are the families displaced from their damaged housing units in North Gaza Governorate (Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia, and Jabalia) due to the recent escalation or returnees&apos; families living in damaged housing units lacking physical protection and exposed to harsh weather, humanitarian and protection concerns. 

This project will complement ongoing NRC emergency intervention targeting the same areas designed to provide conflict-affected and displaced people with a three-month transitional shelter cash assistance (TSCA) and re-integration packages tailored to each household&apos;s needs. NRC fund will also cover hygiene NFI to improve hygiene practices and ensure protection against COVID-19. 

This support will be provided through phased cash payments and technical engineering support or -in exceptional cases- through a contractor approach to conduct urgent repairs up to the minimum shelter cluster standards to provide adequate living space conditions and improve privacy. The repair activities will focus on achieving physical and climate protection as a priority (especially for severely damaged houses) the second priority is adequate living space with working toilet and kitchen facilities and suitable sleeping and living areas. 

The beneficiaries&apos; selection process will prioritize the families with the highest socio-economic and housing status vulnerabilities, focusing on people currently living in overcrowded conditions without age/gender-based separation in bedrooms, female-headed households with low incomes, and people with special needs including pregnant, lactating women, families with numerous children/dependants, elderly headed household with no support, persons with disabilities.

This project is designed after sufficient consultations with NRC local partner, the shelter cluster and the Ministry of Public Work and Housing (MoPWH) to fill the current gap in short-medium term response and coordinated with active shelter partners to avoid duplication and ensure fair distribution of the limited humanitarian funds among affected communities across Gaza Strip.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Shelter Assistance for IDP Families in the Gaza Strip</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project provides for the protection and safety of IDPs whose houses were totally or severely damaged in the last war on the Gaza Strip. In addition, vulnerable families of hardship cases, including Female Headed Households, GBV cases, elderly, and PWDs, who reported minor shelter damages and have been living in poor housing condition will be supported to access dignifying and safe shelters. Different modalities have been suggested with considering to the type of damages, the vulnerabilities profile of the targeted families, the reported priorities, and the responsiveness and efficiency of the modality to provide for IDPs dignity and safety. The modality of implementation includes restricted transitional shelter cash assistance, restricted cash for urgent repair, and one-off cash reintegration package. The project will cover priority gaps in damaged houses in two governorates (Gaza City and the Northern Governorate) and ensure that the affected population has access to adequate shelter. A total of 242 families will be targeted (total individuals of 1460, including 334 girls, 333 boys, 397 women, and 396 men). This project aligns with the allocation strategy Cluster Objective 1 &quot;Supporting access to adequate temporary shelter solutions to displaced persons through the provision of cash programmed assistance, alongside support to host families.&quot;, Objective 2 &quot;Undertaking urgent repair of uninhabitable homes to reduce the displacement caseload, relieve pressure on the growing need for homes and reduce risks for host and hosted families.&quot;, and Objective 3 &quot;Undertaking selective repair for partially damaged homes and adaptation interventions for the most vulnerable groups, including female head-of household, elderly, and PWDs.&quot;. This intervention will be implemented in close coordination with the shelter cluster and the Ministry of Public Works and Housing. MA&#x2019;AN capitalizes on its community-based emergency response structure to support in the implementation process to ensure the accountability to the affected population. The implementation methodology has been set to manage different protection concerns associated with the internally displacement including the COVID-19 pandemic, risks of ERWs, child protection concerns, special needs of PWDs, and GBV.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Immediate rehabilitation of housing of non-refugee internally displaced families in the Gaza Strip &#x2013; May 2021 Gaza Crisis</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will support 135 non-refugee internally displaced families who have been displaced due to the May 2021 hostilities, to rehabilitate their housing so they may safely return to their homes.  The housing rehabilitation intervention, delivered through self-help modality, will allow for 664 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) &#x2013; including Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) to reduce their reliance on Temporary Shelter Cash Assistance (TSCA) and enable them to restore some degree of normality to their lives. 

The beneficiary selection process will be informed by UNDP&#x2019;s infrastructure damage assessment and conducted in coordination with UNRWA and with the Ministry of Public Works and Housing, in order to ensure transparency and complementarity of efforts to reach those most in need and leave no one behind. The vulnerability of families will be taken into consideration while setting priorities, where priority will be given to women-headed households and families with disabled persons. 

The intervention is also urgently needed in light of the dire socio-economic situation in the Gaza Strip, particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Gaza population has become more vulnerable to humanitarian shocks and unable to meet their essential needs, cope with the displacement or repair damages of their homes during the recent hostilities. 

Building on the experience of previous conflicts, UNDP successfully developed Standard Operating Procedures, which include implementation through self-help modality and fund disbursement to beneficiaries utilizing local banks.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rapid response for WASH rehabilitation at HH level</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main purpose of this action is to support the Humanitarian Coordinator to deliver an immediate response to the critical needs as a result of the recent hostilities on the Gaza Strip. The action will last for six months and focuses on the rehabilitation of WASH infrastructure at household level in the areas of North and Middle Gaza Strip. The aim is to provide support through a Cash for material approach to 500 households and also includes the delivery of 500 PE tanks (1.5M3). A team of engineers will evaluate, in collaboration with the beneficiaries, the different needs for each HH in order to provide tailored solutions. Cash for work and cash for assets will be provided to the beneficiaries to perform the rehabilitation. Dignity, protection and safety of target households will be ensured through their involvement in planning and providing acceptable and tailored WASH solutions for each household. 
The commitment of the beneficiary is ensured all along the project, involving them in each step. Through this approach, for instance, HHs will appropriate the rehabilitation work activity, being protagonist of the tailored planning draft and also during the implementation phase, since they will lead the works and have to anticipate resources to complete all repairs before receiving the 2nd instalment.
In this way, the beneficiary will not perceive the activity as a pure assistance action, but a participating one, requesting their active participation.
Also, during field follow up and monitoring visits, all along the activity implementation, CESVI, ACTED and YEC, with the support of the CBPCs, will ensure to maintain and increase the beneficiary commitment through raising awareness, continuous support in problem solving and clarification/mediation of any issue in any phase of the project.
Throughout the implementation of all activities, COVID-19 prevention measures will be integrated to ensure the safety of all beneficiaries and staff. 

The activities will be implemented by CESVI, ACTED and YEC. CESVI and ACTED are members of ALLIANCE2015 and as such have already started emergency response activities immediately after the ceasefire (21st May) with internal funds. The activities here presented will build upon this initial intervention and allow consortium partners to scale up thereby reaching a higher number of beneficiaries. 
The project will be supported by the mainstreaming of an Integrated Protection Approach (IPA), with a specific focus on the most vulnerable groups, including women, girls, boys, the disabled, and the elderly. Gender principles will be mainstreamed throughout the entire action. Project staff and Community Based Protection Committees (CBPCs) will be refreshed about existing referral mechanisms available for protection cases such as gender-based violence (GBV), with a particular focus given to women and children. Finally, Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) will be core to the proposed Action by giving account to, taking account of, and being held to account by affected populations.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WASH rehabilitation of vulnerable households in Gaza strip</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The recent escalation in Gaza led to destruction of many WASH essential infrastructures, which in turn caused the interruption of water supply provision and sewage drainage systems operation. 

 
At households&#x2019; level, the conflict damaged the WASH services of hundreds of flats and houses of vulnerable and poor families drastically deteriorating their hygienic conditions and exposing them to further health risks linked to the increased likelihood of contracting transmissible WASH related diseases. 

Even before the recent conflict in May 2021, Gaza was affected by a dire economic crisis, which has been even further exacerbated by the secondary impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. With pre-conflict and pre-Covid baselines of high rates of poverty (53%), highest ever-recorded unemployment rate (46.7 %) (with youth and female unemployment even higher at 70% and 78% respectively), we can only assume that the situation has worsened with the latest unrest. This therefore translates in already vulnerable and poor families having an additionally reduced capacity to repair damages and purchase essential hygiene items. In addition to exposing many vulnerable individuals to unsanitary conditions, the fragility of the WASH environment may also jeopardize effective hygiene practices to prevent and control the active pandemic. 

This project will reduce health risks through household level WASH rehabilitations.


As for the household level intervention, SC will improve the hygiene conditions 470 vulnerable households in North Gaza and eastern Gaza families through targeted and punctual repairs of the damaged WASH facilities   in their homes and improve access to water by improving water drainage capacity . SC will select beneficiaries based on the vulnerability criteria and level of needs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Livelihood Support to Affected Farmers</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to provide one-time direct support through agricultural inputs vouchers tailored to agricultural livelihood activities in the Gaza Strip. Those include open field farmers, greenhouse farmers, and poultry farmers affected by the COVID-19 economic crisis and those severely impacted by weather events during last winter and early spring (heat wave). This has resulted in high losses of farmer&#x2019;s produce, harvest and livestock and affected farmer&#x2019;s coping capacities which are posing risks to mitigating upcoming stressors.
Oxfam and its partner-Palestinian Environment Friends (PEF)- will closely coordinate the implementation of the proposed project with the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and FSS. The list of targeted affected farmers is registered at, and later verified and assessed by the MoA. The project will specifically target 754 small scale farmers and their households (4,146 individuals) affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and weather events. Targeted farmers will be supported with vouchers ranging between USD 500 and USD 750. Targeted farmers have been selected in consultation with FSS and MoA with the following selection criteria: open field farmers with 5 dunums and less affected by winter storms and flooding, greenhouse farmers of 2 arches affected by winter storms, and poultry farmers affected by the April 2021 heat wave.
PEF will carry out a random verification to a sample of 20% of potential list of beneficiaries to validate the data provided by MoA. Oxfam and PEF will carry out a rapid market assessment to evaluate the availability and prices of items needed by farmers to recover their lands and to continue carrying out their farming and livelihoods activities. The market assessment will also ensure that commodity voucher items are specified based on (a) types/classification of agricultural activities and (b) physical accessibility of farmers. Farmers will be provided with one-time inputs vouchers that will allow them to reach designated suppliers who will be contracted by Oxfam. Farmers will redeem vouchers with specific items within a 4-week period. PEF will monitor the voucher redemption in target areas to ensure suppliers&#x2019; compliance with specified restricted items. Oxfam will utilize its electronic e-voucher system (RedRose) to monitor the voucher redemption based on assigned prices identified during the market assessment. The use of the e-voucher modality will facilitate the real time monitoring of the voucher redemption and will enable Oxfam to report on the types of commodities that farmers will purchase (redeem). After distribution, Oxfam and PEF will carry out random post distribution monitoring (PDM) to collect feedback on targeted farmers&#x2019; satisfaction of the assistance provided.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Scale-up laboratory diagnostics of COVID-19 and risk communication and community engagement in Gaza</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">One year and one month ago, on the 11 March 2020, the WHO announced the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Since then, the MoH has reported a cumulative total of 327,044 confirmed cases across the oPt as a whole, with 18,913 active cases (as of 4-May-2021, 16:00hrs). Regrettably, 3,551 people have died due to COVID-19, in oPt. Local authorities in the Gaza Strip have so far reported a total of 102,074 confirmed cases, out of which 11,964 are still active cases (as of 4-May-2021, 16:00hrs). 914 people have died in Gaza due to due to COVID-19. There are currently 1,000 new active cases a day in the Gaza Strip. Since the onset of the pandemic, the WHO office in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) and partners have lent their support to the Palestinian health authorities to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. With the increase in active COVID-19 case numbers and deaths over the last year and more since the first reported cases in the oPt, their efforts have been intensifying. 

The overall objective of this project is to help contain the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 in the oPt focusing on the Gaza Strip. The project aims to strengthen and scale up the capacity to early detect COVID-19 and adequately trace contacts of confirmed cases in Gaza and to scale up risk communication and community engagement to improve the COVID-19 vaccination uptake.. 

WHO will support the Gaza health authorities in: (1) increasing COVID-19 diagnostics capacity through ensuring adequate and consistent supply of testing kits, and (2) increasing risk communication and community engagement to ensure adherence to effective public health measures as well as encouraging demand for vaccination take-up while scaling up vaccination roll-out across Gaza. Vaccine hesitancy is a key element in the slow uptake in numbers of Gazans willing to get vaccinated. WHO estimates that up to 110,000 women and men in Gaza Strip will have access to adequate COVID-19 screening through laboratory testing. At least 500,000 Palestinians in Gaza would receive public health messages on improved vaccine uptake</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening of Public health Capacity and Service Delivery during COVID-19 outbreak in the Gaza Strip</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The steep increase of COVID-19 cases in the Gaza Strip during April 2021, increased the pressure on the health system and further compromised the fragile living positions of the most vulnerable families.

The project will contribute to respond to the current peak of COVID-19 infection, alleviate the most urgent needs of vulnerable families, and contribute to limit the destabilizing effects of the current public health emergency in the Gaza Strip.

The intervention will reinforce the immediate response of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in the Gaza Strip to prevent and treat the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic through procurement of essential COVID-19 medical supplies including, ICU and ultra-cold chain equipment for COVID-19 vaccines to the designated health facilities.

The project will respond to the two key components of the Health Cluster Response Plan, namely a) to support MoH to stop the human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 and provide adequate care for patients affected by COVID-19, their families, and close contacts b) to Strengthening and Scale-up MoH capacity to early detect and respond to COVID-19 outbreak.

The allocation is a critical emergency response to provide support to around five health care facilities (HCF) in the Gaza Strip which have been designated by the MoH to be used for treating patients from COVID-19.  In addition, the medical central store and designated health facility will be equipped with ultra&#x2013;cold chain equipment to store properly the COVID 19 vaccine. 

These facilities lack adequate medical equipment needed to ensure safe and proper case management of COVID-19 patients. They also lack the ultra-cold chain equipment which is required to ensure the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines. This will feed into the work currently being undertaken by UNICEF with MoH and WHO with regards to rollout of COVID-9 vaccination aimed at increasing vaccine uptake across the country.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To contribute to food consumption of the most vulnerable HHs affected by flood and pandemic through emergency food assistance in Sindh.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a result of heavy torrential rains that started in early August and continued with intermission until 31 August, many parts of Sindh province were left flooded, with losses of life and damages to infrastructure reported. As per primary and secondary sources Umerkot, and Mirpurkhas are among the most affected districts. This four-month proposed intervention aims to meet the immediate lifesaving needs of 5300 flood and COVID-19 pandemic affected households through general food distribution programming in districts Umerkot and Mirpurkhas in Sindh province, Pakistan. This needs-based flood response is designed to support flood and pandemic affected vulnerable communities&#x2019; immediate life-saving needs. Given the scale and extent of the disaster and needs for FSL assistance for affected vulnerable communities and the gap to provide lifesaving assistance, these two districts are prioritized for this ACTED&#x2019;s intervention to support vulnerable communities in meeting their life-saving needs. ACTED aims to mobilize resources and build upon existing capacities to respond to the flood and pandemic emergency in districts Umerkot and  Mirpurkhas in Sindh. ACTED will target the most affected Union Councils (UCs) of the two districts, already identified in close consultation with the sector lead (WFP) and the authorities for the distribution of food in three cycles to 5,300 HHs. (3 cycles to distribute a half month ration in each cycle: wheat flour 40 Kg, Vegetable oil 2.5kg, Yellow spread pulses 04 kg and salt 100 g per cycle). Since the District authorities (Deputy Commissioner&#x2019;s Office and DDMA) have themselves requested for assistance and emergency response in the affected areas, as such, no formal NOC requirements are needed to be fulfilled to intervene in the mentioned districts. Furthermore, prevailing vulnerabilities and needs such as food insecurity and lack of economic/livelihood opportunities, along with the existing operational presence of ACTED, have been taken into account. ACTED is a long-standing actor in the proposed districts, is currently working there and is accepted and known among communities and the authorities.  
For beneficiaries targeting, ACTED aims to target the most vulnerable communities and households in the selected districts. In total, the project will support the priority needs of (food security) 5300 households (31,800 individuals &#x2013; family size 6 members) in district Umerkot and Mirpurkhas over a period of four months. The distribution will be done in close coorrdination and monitoring by WFP, UNOCHA and  PDMA /DDMA will monitor the process in entire distribution.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The people of Balochistan are faced with multiple crisis in the recent past. The level of vulnerabilities exacerbated with recurrent drought spells, specifically the last spell between 2007-2019 (1.79 Million Affectees) added serious and irreversible damages to the livelihood patterns of inhabitants. Moreover, above normal rainfall and snowfall throughout 2019-20 turned into flash flooding and snow emergency (1.1 Million Affectees) resultantly marked 48% rural population in IPC phase 3 (crisis) and 4 (emergency). The district of Chaghai is among the worst affected list where around 65% of district population were labelled in phase 3 or above of IPC exercise in 2019. The situation should have compounded with COVID outbreak and Locust attack. The socio-economic impact of COVID-19 are much more significant than its health adversaries COVID will push additional 2.5 million people food insecure in the country by the end of this year. 
District Chaghai is the largest and most sparsely populated district of Pakistan, the level of vulnerabilities for the district are even the highest among the districts of Balochistan. Chaghai became the limelight of COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan right from the beginning since religious pilgrims from Iran were suspected to be the first victims and/or carriers of Corona in Pakistan. The restrictions imposed during the pandemic have not only increased the cost of living, as well as travelling restrictions aggravate the hardships of the working community with restricted work opportunities. 
IR has conducted a remotely monitored rapid need assessment exercise within its targeted communities during the Pandemic (July 2020. The finding of the exercise in district Chaghai did validate that the menace of the pandemic and its consequences on socio-economic sectors are as harsh as that of the country. The income level have been reduced more than 50% while the efficacy of service delivery has been curtailed to a large extent. Two third of the respondents (71%) share that their livelihood sources have been severely impaired due to the lockdown. 10% respondents that their resources for 50 to 100% have been affected and now that are out of options to earn a living a spend a life upright
IR is targeting Rabi planting season in district Chaghai as well as emphasizing on the protection of livelihood assets. The proposed module is more align with the strategic priorities of Agriculture and Food Security Working group, formally endorsed from the Agriculture line Departments and more importantly in line with the Response Strategy of Islamic Relief against COVID-19. The proposed interventions within the agriculture and livestock sectors (crops support, capacity building session in both agriculture and livestock sectors, restocking of poultry birds and ruminants, veterinary services, and cash grants for service providers in value chain) are estimated to reach 16,925 individuals in district Chaghai, including 5585 men, 5247 women, 3050 boys, 3043 girls and 677 disable persons as targeted direct beneficiaries. The need identification survey and consultation with line departments confirm 5 Union Councils (Barabcha, Chilghazi, Pat Gwanako, Ziarat Balnosh, and Amuri) for effective targeting. Within these Union Councils, population residing along border areas have peculiar needs and vulnerabilities owing to intensified restrictions in terms of livelihood opportunities due to border closures and security concerns. Though the specific outputs of the project are humanitarian in nature  , the outcome drawn are convincingly provide an enabling environment for long lasting impacts. The interventions proposed are evolving around sustainable livelihood options keeping in mind &#x2018;do no harm&#x2019; principles and SPHERE standards. Moreover, 2080 afghan refugees will be targeted for necessary agriculture and livestock interventions to complement their food security needs from household sources and augment their nutritional needs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cash for Work Assistance to COVID-19 Affected Vulnerable Population in district Chaghi.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COVID-19 pandemic has further added to the complexity of the humanitarian situation existing in district Chaghi due to drought, floods, locust swarms and long existing multidimensional chronic poverty. District Chaghi continues holding bottom ranks on human development index.  Balochistan DNS 2019  reported that in district chaghi 74% of the households were moderately or severely food insecure whereas 22% were severely food insecure. 

Agriculture, which is the mainstay of the district&#x2019;s economy had been adversely impacted by the drought. Unavailability of agricultural inputs, lack of manpower, financial constraints and unavailability of seeds, loss/lack of draught animals further aggravate the situation. Livelihood of a significant number of people in chaghi also depends on cross border trade with Afghanistan recent fencing on the border between the two countries has also disrupted the livelihoods of the hundreds of people involved in this economic activity.  

Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the livelihood of all socioeconomic groups in the district hardest hit are the daily wage earners, small-scale men/women farmers and agriculture labor dependent on sustenance agriculture, in both Afghan refugee and the host communities in the area. 
These vulnerable groups have limited capacity to purchase food. It is feared that the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the adoption of the negative coping strategies, such as limiting dietary intake and diversification, distress sale of productive assets and seed stocks and borrowing at exorbitant mark-ups in order to meet their household food and non-food needs. Immediate assistance to acquire life sustaining food can be the difference between life and death for a great number of people surviving the situation so far.

The proposed intervention will address the immediate life sustaining food/nutritional needs of the most vulnerable people both in Afghan refugees and host communities in UCs through CBT both unconditional and in exchange for work and trainings depending on whether the concerned beneficiaries are unable or able to participate in work/training. Inability to participate in work/training could be on the grounds of age, disability, illness and pregnancy/child care related issues. Community&#x2019;s resilience will also be built in their fight against COVID-19 by providing them necessary information, equipment and supplies to follow SOPs for prevention and protection.  The proposed target UCs are selected using FS VAM  exercise results and are in line with its priority one. 
Afghan refugee communities in the area are organized in three revenue villages (RV) namely RV chaghi, RV Posti, and RV Ljy karaze with a total population of 57159. TF proposes to select 200 beneficiary HHs from each of the three RVs (a total of 600 households benefiting 4&#x2019;560 individuals) the selection will be done in close coordination with the target RVs and UNHCR. 

70 households (525 persons), will benefit from unconditional cash transfer
1440 household (10&#x2019;800 persons) will participate in cash for work.
77 physical infrastructure schemes will be constructed/rehabilitated, out of which
10 will be of drinking water and the rest of the 67 schemes of irrigation and flood protection schemes.
1210 women will participate in training programs on kitchen gardening, food safety nutrition, COVID-19 prevention and TF&#x2019;s accountability mechanism).
90 VDCs M/Fmembers&#x2019; orientation/training on protection, GBV, COVID 19 risk reduction measures.
600 Refugee H/Hs will receive poultry bird kits and FFS support regarding poultry management, production, breeding and poultry disease control to increase household protein production. 
Inclusivity, protection and gender equality/women empowerment will be central focus of all the interventions in this project. TF will closely coordinate with PDMA, DDMA, local authorities, UNHCR, UN Food WASH, Livelihoods clusters UNOCHA and other working in the area.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving the food security, nutrition and livelihoods of vulnerable households affected by the COVID-19.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project supplements and strengthens Government of Pakistan and Balochistan&#x2019;s effort for the fight against COVID-19 through the provision of livelihood support and increasing the food security of vulnerable HHs in three districts of Balochistan. The overall objective of the project is to assist the poor households in improving their overall food security, nutritional status and livelihoods of vulnerable households in five (05) most vulnerable Union Councils (UCs) three (03) most affected districts i.e. Pishin, Jhal Magsi and Washuk of Balochistan province. The target UCs include 1. Kazha Viala 2. Narain (tehsil Barshor, district Pishin) 3. Hathyari 4. Jhal Magsi (of tehsil and district Jhal Magsi) 5. Palantak (tehsil and district Washuk)  The selected UCs for the proposed project had been identified as priority UCs under Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) for Food Security Analysis. While, the proposed interventions such as the provision of cash grants, crop production support to the small farmers and provision of livestock assets are also aligned with the food security cluster&#x2019;s priorities for this grant. The emergency livelihood restoration support planned under this project include: 

- 1,680 Ultra and Vulnerable Poor households identified and selected for the planned support:
This activity will provide the basis for the distribution of planned packages to the vulnerable households in VAM prioritised target UCs. For the identification and selection purpose, the poverty scorecard (PSC) data will be used. This data has been collected under an EU funded on-going programme by applying recognised poverty scorecard tool, which is widely used for the household targeting purpose for livelihood and social safety net programmes. However, to further validate and ensure the identification of target households FGDs will be held in the villages of target UC and BRSP fostered community institutions will be engaged for the endorsement of selected beneficiaries for the following packages.

a. 700 Ultra and Vulnerable Poor HHs provided with Unconditional Cash Grants:
This activity will primarily focus on the women, persons with disability (PWD), child-headed households and/or the households with unemployed head.

b. 280 Agriculture farmers provided with Crops Production Support. 
This activity will focus the small agriculture farmers with cultivable lands up to 5-6 acres, whose livelihood activities have been affected by the recent pandemic and/or disasters such as drought, heavy rains and flash-floods.

c. 700 Smallholder livestock farmers are provided with Livestock assets/other support 
This support is planned for the smallholder livestock farmers or households with the capacity to manage livestock. This will be a women-focused activity, as in rural settings usually, women are responsible to manage this activity. 

Besides, the provision of livelihood support to the vulnerable HHs the proposed project also integrates to reaching out the population with a mass awareness on Risk Communication during training sessions and awareness-raising through masajid in all target UCs. As far as the breakdown of planned deliverables for each target area is concerned, the activity &#x201C;crop production support to agri-farmers&#x201D; will only be carried out in two union councils of Jhal Magsi district as these both UCs are mostly agri-dependents while at the initial stage targets of other two activities i.e. unconditional cash grants and livestock are equally being planned for each target UCs. However, the actual distribution of the planned support is highly dependent on the validation of PSC data and the results of focus group discussions for the identification and selection of beneficiaries. The project will be implemented through the participation of Community Institutions fostered at Village amp UC level by BRSP and the cadre CRPs at each UC which will be a key in ensuring efficiency and effectiveness.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food Security Response for vulnerable population of district Jhal Magsi, Balochistan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to contribute to the PHPF 1st allocation strategy&#x2019;s objective of  providing humanitarian support to those whose livelihoods are severely affected and suffering from food insecurity. The project also targets to respond to the recent floods of August 2020.  

Following the floods, we carried out a Rapid damage and needs assessment and are proposing the following union councils:
TEHSIL GANDAWA: Union Councils Khari, Patri, Mirpur and 
TEHSIL JHAL MAGSI: Union Council Mat Sundar

During the need assessment, we found that different groups have different needs. There are those who have suffered significant losses and are unable to meet daily food consumption needs, their agriculture infrastructure is damaged but they have access to seeds for next cropping season. For such beneficiaries we have proposed 3 cycles of cash transfers through Cash for Work.

On the other hand, there are affected families whose head is an elderly or PWD or have other chronic condition due to which they are unable to work, for such beneficiaries we have proposed unconditional cash transfers (3 cycles)

Then there are affected families who cannot meet their food consumption requirements and do not have any arrangements for next cropping season. Such families are at a high risk for missing sowing season and are prone to relying on negative coping mechanisms. For such families, we have proposed a CASH+ packages (combination of cash and in kind Crop support). This will enable the families to meet immediate food needs while ensuring they have adequate arrangement for next cropping season. They will be provided cash grants for two months whereas an agriculture inputs package will also be provided to them. The input package proposed is climate smart and promises better results in terms of yields and water use classifying the package as an innovation. Therefore, for diffusion of innovation and ensuring adaptability, we will use a Farmer&#x2019;s Field School (initially facilitated by our field teams) where farmers, on regular intervals, will gather in small groups and will share their learning, approaches, what works and what doenst while our staff will also provide key inputs. 

Particularly for females, we have proposed a locally suited and culturally contextualized solution. We will enhance house hold food security through kitchen gardening. Women will be trained on managing kitchen gardening, knowledge amp skills on nutritional diet and COVID 19 prevention. Then they will be provided with a kitchen gardening package including assorted seeds and tools. Our teams will provide demonstration during the training and women will be extended support for sowing and managing their kitchen gardens by our staff. On the other hand, women will also be enrolled in a Farmer Field School. Through that, they will meet in small groups and discuss their approaches to gardening thereby creating a platform for exchange of ideas and sharing lessons learned.

Lastly, there are beneficiaries who rely mainly on livestock farming. Their food security is linked with viable livestock raising and selling. Since the floods have severely affected the grazing lands (referring to our assessment report) we will ensure viability of these farmers and their grazing lands through provision of fodder seeds and related inputs. Without such inputs, these farmers are at the risk of being further pushed in misery since they are likely to suffer from livestock death, weight loss and selling the livestock on significant losses. 

Furthermore, we have been undertaking similar projects in same region since 2010 in partnership with UNWFP and UNFAO. Since September 2020, we are also implementing an emergency response project in partnership with IRC in proposed district Jhal Magsi. For cash transfers, irrigation infrastructure, kitchen gardening, FFS and Fodder packages, we have in-house highly qualified staff with relevant qualification.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food for survival project for flood affected families of districts Sanghar and Badin, Sindh</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the month of August 2020, heavy rainfall resulted in major flooding in the Province of Sindh amp a province-wide Monsoon Flood Emergency was declared by the Government of Sindh on 25th August 2020. Subsequently on 29th August the provincial Government officially declared 20 districts as &#x201C;calamity affected areas&#x201D;, under the Sindh National Calamities (Prevention amp Relief) Act 1958. Pakistan is prone to multiple natural hazards, including floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides, snowfall, avalanches amp cyclones. The recent flooding has affected communities in both rural amp urban Sindh. In addition to crops, livestock amp houses, a lot of infrastructure has been damaged amp in some cases, people have been forced to take shelter in temporary camps.
The project will focus to provide the of food package to the flood affected communities to reduce the mortality amp morbidity among flood affected population through life saving food assistance amp as a direct or indirect consequence of COVID-19 outbreak in district Sanghar amp  Badin. Project activities include: 
Affected areas selection, selection of the most vulnerable families with the support of local CBOs, notables amp government officials. Then the verification and validation of selected beneficiaries will be conducted by HANDS MER Department in coordination with the respective district governments. Tokens in the name of beneficiary head of house hold will be generated through digitalized Beneficiary Management Information System (BMIS). Food commodities/items as per the given guidelines, will be procured by HANDS procurement and logistics department. Each district team will submit the detailed distribution plan. Accessible distribution points will be selected with community participation. HANDS Suggestion And Complaint (SAC) banner will be displayed at distribution points along with the list of food items. SAC brochures will also be given to the beneficiaries. HANDS District Executive Managers/ Project manager will orient the beneficiaries about COVID-19 preventive measures, details about the food package amp inclusion of all family members without any discrimination. 
  
The project is designed to cater the specific needs of women, men, girls, boys amp vulnerable groups in wake of heavy rains flood situation. The project intends to focus on specific areas of interventions recommended by the RNA to response the immediate needs in Food Security sector. HANDS proposed intervention districts Sanghar amp Badin are included in PHPF Five prioritized districts in Sindh for immediate response. The general food distribution plan (as per standard foods quantity) for specific duration for vulnerable families is proposed focused on men, women, children &#x2013; girls and boys, persons with disabilities, pregnant lactating mothers. The beneficiaries&#x2019; selection will be done on defined criteria, with support of district authorities, DDMA amp other stakeholders. 

Project staff will be oriented on HANDS Gender policy amp Protocols, GBV, PSEA, Leave No One Behind, Do No Harm amp Sphere standards. HANDS management amp monitoring team will ensure to implement on these policies amp protocols in the field. Community will be oriented about HANDS SAC policy, procedure amp contact numbers for any complaint amp information about any incident/ discrimination. HANDS senior management as per the defined protocol will address the complaint- if any. 

The migration of people due to flood situation is an immediate risk for project activities. Another risk is the security amp safety of the teams due to local conflicts amp large number of affected population. Coordination with district government amp community engagement may help to tackle this issue on the whole process of selection and food ration distribution. There are chances of second wave of COVID-19 to be observed intervention districts. To cope with this situation, PPEs amp orientation on COVID-19 prevention. SOPs will be provided to staff amp awareness will be provided to communities.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2019-20 COVID-19 pandemic have reached Pakistan in February 2020. As of May 14, 2020, the number of confirmed cases in the country is 35793, with 9690 recoveries and 775 deaths. Punjab is currently the region with highest number of cases at over 13561.  COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
The fragile health care system in Pakistan has further weakened on the onset of COVID- 19 where extra measures and steps are being required to combat the current pandemic situation and also continue the regular health care services to regular diseases like PHC, MNCH, SRH, Immunization and ANC, PNC care etc. The data shows that health care workers including Doctors and Paramedic and other health staff in health facilities are at high risk due non availability of appropriate PPEs, lack of capacities to handle corona patients&#x2019; situations, lack of proper equipping/ disinfecting the health facilities to control transmitting the virus in the premises of health facilities. This challenging situation has already taken the lives of frontline health staff and are constantly being affecting from the virus which is resulting in the gravity of the situation and need immediate response to tackle these issues and ensure enhanced capacity of the health care system at hospitals and in outreach health services to continue provision of the regular health services along with treatment of the corona patients.

In response the challenging situation out of COVID-19 pandemic, SHED will conduct capacity building/training program of the health staff including doctors, paramedics, vaccinators and outreach health workers in the targeted health facilities. The trainings will focus on IPC and other preventive measures as per WHO guidelines and protocols to continue essential regular health services in hospitals and in communities through outreach. The project will also organize trainings on implementation and monitoring of guidelines and protocols to health care providers. The health care workers at community level will be provided with trainings on preventive measures in COVID-19 situation for awareness raising in communities. The project will procure and provide appropriate PPE to targeted health facilities. For disinfection and infection prevention at facility level, the project will provide services to keep disinfecting the targeted health facilities with different measures hand sensitization of individuals, disinfecting OPDs, Wards, OTs, Labour Rooms, Testing Laboratories, staff offices, waiting rooms etc with approved sprays. This activity will continue through the project life. Medical supplies, RH medicines, dignity, newborn baby and delivery kits will be provided to the health facilities to continue outreach services at community level. The project will provide ambulance services to the selected health facilities on need basis. These services will be utilized for continuation of CEmOC services at tertiary care hospitals for referral cases. The project will identify and actively engage different community forums like District Support Groups, Local Support Organizations and Community Based Organizations to participate and support the project activities.

The project will focus on inclusion of gender, vulnerable population including age, PWDs, children, minority and ethnic groups, widows, orphans, transgender and extremely poors in all project activities. Ongoing monitoring along with line departments and communities will be an integral part of the project to ensure accountability and transparency. Protection of vulnerable groups will be ensured in each activity of the project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support to EPI Balochistan in response to COVID-19 to resume Routine Immunization</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since COVID-19 appeared in Pakistan, Federal and Balochistan Government has responded with involvement of Health Deptt. All primary amp essential healthcare services were suspended including Routine Immunization (RI). Fully immunized coverage of Baluchistan is 29% which is the lowest in country. The other alarming figure is 24% Children with zero dose of any antigen. The performance of immunization program has improved with more focus from government/partner organization(s) but still a lot of efforts are required to achieve global/regional goals. Knowing that Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) cause around 24% of the mortality among children under five, continuation of RI services is imperative to avert the thousands of deaths.

The health system is already burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic and in order to counter future outbreak of any disease it was considered important that the routine immunization be resumed so that efforts made from decades may not be futile. Through this intervention, TF strives to strengthen EPI Program Balochistan in ensuring personal protection of EPI frontline workers, build trust of parents of children that vaccination staff is well prepared to prevent exposure of children during immunization process. The proposed project will supplement resumption of RI activities with safety of 1422 staff in 03 high risk districts i.e. Quetta, Pishin amp Killa Abdullah is ensured for at least 04 months period through provision of  Personal Protective Equipment (Masks, Gloves, Sanitizers, Disposable Gowns) to EPI Balochistan frontline workforce particularly Vaccinators, Lady Health Workers and Monitors. This will support the resumption of smooth routine immunization service with precautionary measures at frontline workers&#x2019; end, static EPI centers with hand washing protection and disinfection. The project will target the high-risk districts of Balochistan in both contexts&#x2019; vaccination under EPI and the Covid-19 with highest number of cases in targeted districts.  TF will also produce the advocacy material on COVID-19 precautions as well as social distancing protocols at district/community level as an integration to EPI activities. On the other hand, TF will develop IEC material regarding EPI in COVID-19 pandemic situation and importance of both the routine immunization and precautionary measures including social-distancing would be shared through a dedicated campaigning on social media (targeted advertisement) and at the static vaccination points with the information material (non-transferable) while important places at each district will be covered with IEC material placed in shape of banners/posters. All the 126 static centers will also be provided with the hand washing units with availability of soaps/water. The 126 facilities will also be provided with disinfectant liquid for the static facility disinfection with sprayer tools supporting routine disinfectant activities. 

The project will also focus on capacity building of the EPI frontline workers (Vaccinators, LHWs amp Monitors) focusing IPC protocols and guideline developed by federal EPI with technical support of WHO. Training of Trainers (ToT) will be conducted involving existing trainers from EPI/MNCH programs amp consultants. These MTs will be responsible to undertake trainings at the field in 03 districts to orient the front-line workforce on IPC in context of COVID-19 to resume the RI with precautionary measures and stop the spread of not only COVID-19 but other infections too. 

The overall support under the proposed project will be to operationalize the essential service of RI activities in 03 high risk districts through by EPI Balochistan for at least 04 months with minimum safeguarding against the COVID-19 spread with the approach of providing PPE to Frontline workers, capacity building on Infection prevention and control, hand washing and disinfection of EPI static centers, advocacy at district level through Social Media amp IEC Material.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pakistan has witnessed a massive increase in its confirmed cases from the initial two confirmed cases on 26th February 2020. As a country whose economy is highly reliant on manufacturing and service industries, shutdown measures and disruptions in supply chains has negatively impact on the economy and society, particularly the poor. The shutdown measures have already impacted small businesses, small and medium enterprises and daily wagers associated with various sectors of the economy. 
The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Pakistan has risen to 40,151 as of 17 May 2020. Increase of 1,352 new cases in the last 24 hours. Test conducted so far is 359,264 out of which 1, 1341 recovered and 873 deaths. The most affected province due to COVID-19 virus in Punjab 14,584, followed by Sindh with 15,590 cases. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the total confirm cases are 5,847 with 305 deaths and 1,699 cases recovered. Active cases in KP is 3,843 which increases on daily basis.There are limited number of laboratories with limited capacity to confirm COVID-19 cases. Substantial progress in Laboratory testing has been made, daily testing capacity has increased from 6700 on April 22, to 13051 on May 13, 2020. This capacity is expected to reach 20,000 per day. Total 330750 tests have been performed as of May 14, i.e. KP 34352.  Given the current positivity rate of 8%, we, therefore, need to conduct 2 million tests to reach the projected 9,049 test per 1,000,000. The average local transmission in the country is around 89%: Sindh 92.69%, Punjab 86.18%, KP 85.49%, and Baluchistan 93.39%. 
The isolation and quarantine facilities are inadequate in number and the infrastructure unsuitable for isolation and quarantine. The standard operating procedures (SoPs) are not being implemented at both the isolation and quarantine facilities the facilities lack human resources, technical expertise, supplies, equipment and proper management. The people being quarantined or isolated are not properly briefed on the importance of social distancing and hygiene. Keeping in view the consistent spread and high ratio of confirmed COVID-19 cases need urgent support to the PDMA, DoH, District Administration in the most affected districts of KP i.e. Peshawar and Swat.  
To provide immediate support in COVID-19 Pandemic and EHSAR strong sectoral experience the following allocation strategic activities have been selected with close consultation of district Administration, PDMA and DoH after proper Need Assessment.

	Training and Capacity Building of government and private health facilities staff (doctors, paramedical, vaccinator, and disease surveillance officer etc) to continue providing essential health services including provision of IPC, MNCH, immunization, antenatal, postnatal care and safe delivery services.  
	Support outreach activities through provision of medicines, medical supplies, maternal lifesaving supplies, modern contraceptives, and availability of basic maternal health equipment
	Provision of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment for government, community and   Public Health  Facilities including  Doctors, paramedics, LHW, CMW, FWW, FWAs, LHV, Dispensers, WMO/MOs and vaccinators.  
	Ensure continuity and effectively operationalized mobile units&#x2019; services in two districts of KP   to strengthen CEmOC referral and onsite SRH, including EmOC and maternal health care services.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening Molecular laboratory Capacity for  COVID-19 testing in Pakistan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The first case of the COVID-19 pandemic was notified in Pakistan on the 26th February 2020 from Karachi. As of 8th May 2020, a total of 25, 837 cases with 594 deaths (CFR 2.29%) had been reported. The National Institute of Health, the national reference public health laboratories acquired the requisite technical capacity for COVID-19 diagnostics on 1 February 2020. Since then the government has established over 50 other centres across Pakistan with capacities to conduct confirmatory tests for COVID-19. The centres are in all provinces and regions.  The centres have capacities to conduct up to 12000 tests/day. Over 60 technical staff has been trained on the testing protocols. The Technical Working Group on laboratory has developed key guidance documents for laboratory namely: National Guidance on sample collection, storage and transport of suspected COVID-19 samples, recommendations for priority COVID-19 testing and Recommendations for COVID-19 Laboratory Diagnostics and Quality Control. To date, over 257, 247 samples have been tested at these laboratories. 
The predicative analysis of expected cases load on the laboratory based on the attack rates from other countries indicates that there are likely to be over 196,421 cases in Pakistan. At the current detection rate of 8-9%, this will require a minimum of 3.136 million laboratory diagnostic tests to be conducted. In view of the predicted increased testing requirements for COVID-19 testing across Pakistan, there is urgent need to clearly map and expand the lab detection capacity to high case burden areas, linking the laboratory network with designated quarantine and health/isolation facilities to ensure early case finding, case isolation, contact tracing and management of confirmed cases. This project will contribute to increasing the numbers of testing sites as seen in the map 1 below. 
 
Key activities will include 
1. Support the diagnostic capacity at the existing laboratories through provision of Real Time PCR diagnostic kits amp reagents 
2. Procurement of Point of Care Testing (POCT) equipment and testing kits for the 10 laboratories
3. Installation of the Point of Care Testing (POCT) equipment at the identified labs with validation
4. Training of the facility staff by the equipment provider under supervision of WHO and NIH
5. Monitoring and evaluation of the POCT performance through retesting/rechecking
It is envisaged that these activities will contribute to increasing the number of tests for COVID-19 to a level of 20,000  per 1,000,000 people up from the current level of 1165 test per 1,000,000 (11000-12,000 tests per day).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of WASH assistance to the 5000 Flood-affected families in five Union Councils Satriyoon, Araro Bhurguri, Samaro road, Samaro, and Gulzar Khalil of Tehsil Samaro, district Umerkot.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AWARE will provide WASH assistance to approximately 5000 families (Approximately 38,700 individuals (11,940 men, 12,265 women, 7133 boys, and 7362 girls) in through integrated WASH assistance over a period of three months. Based on the identified needs, to the most vulnerable and flood-affected persons targeted five Union Councils, Satriyoon, Araro Bhurguri, Samaro road, Samaro, and Gulzar Khalil of Taluka Samaro in district Umerkot are selected for humanitarian assistance in close coordination with District authorities, local communities, and civil society organizations.

Along the needs assessment conducted by One UN Provincial Programme Team Sindh, local partner&#x2019;s coordination with relevant stakeholders in Umerkot also guided the planning of culturally sensitive and locally relevant activities for emergency WASH assistance for sustainable resistance of the flood-affected communities. The AWARE team is already working in the proposed area since last decade and based on the information collected during recent flood assessment, regular coordination meeting with district authority during this emergency, reports of different stakeholders (government, I/NGOs, media, etc), generated a Flood Situation Report in August 2020.

Due to heavy rain torrential rains, many districts of Sindh (Umerkot and others) were severely affected by the floods The floods damaged the areas that were already extremely poor and added to the miseries of the people by creating food insecurity, shortage of safe drinking water (62%) and widespread of water-borne diseases in the area. Although there were efforts under a tent, cooked food by Government but there are many still pockets which still have an unmet need for improved quality of drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, and food security. AWARE being one of the organizations already worked with communities of the flood-affected area in the year 2011 with UNICEF and water Aid with the mandate for the provision of WASH services to the flood-affected communities.
&#x2028;The focus of the proposed interventions will be on the provision of access to potable water and the economic survival of flood-affected households. WASH interventions will include 02 water filtration units and 03 water tankering and aqua tabs to access and availability of safe drinking water for 5000 most flood-affected populations. For access to safe sanitation in flood-affected areas, the pit latrines will be provided with the inclusion of men and women, girls and boys of the communities&apos;. AWARE also will carry out hygiene promotion activities through inclusive and culturally compatible utilization approaches and NFI ( Mosquito nets, Jerrican and Tarpaulin sheets, and hygiene kits will be provided to ensure the personal hygiene along with these awareness-raising sessions on personal hygiene and COVID-19 will be conducted according to social distancing in designated SOPs.&#x2028;Transparency and accountability will be ensured through maximum participation of the right holders in beneficiaries selection coupled with cross verification of selected households through community-managed structures, project staff, and monitoring team members to office. The AWARE team will ensure compliance of PHPF gender criteria, CHS, and SPHERE standards. &#x2028;In close coordination with PHPF and WASH cluster will deter duplication of efforts through regular information sharing on the flood portal of UNOCHA and at district / provincial coordination forums. The main purpose of this project is to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and to help reduce the incidence of water, sanitation and hygiene, and related disease by providing WASH humanitarian assistance to most flood-affected families.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian crisis in Districts of Sanghar and Badin is getting worse due to rain flood 2020 causing approximately 400 thousands rural people living in both districts flood affected areas in accessing water and sanitation facilities. Taluka Khipro of district Sanghar is the largest Taluka of the country and has two distinct geographical portions: i.e. the irrigated area in the north and west and the desert in the south and east. All the eleven sub units (union councils) of Taluka Khipro in irrigated area are officially declared as Calamity Effected Areas in district of Sanghar. Whereas as Badin is also flood prone area and is heavily effected by Floods 2020 and is declared calamity hit area. Access to portable water remains of high concern and is intensified by the needs of livestock animals. Moreover, due to stagnant rain flood waters in Districts of Sanghar and Badin,  communities are displaced from their villages and have taken temporary shelters in camps (managed by district Govt:) and on road sides and flood bund embankments 

According to Rapid Needs Assessment 2020 conducted by UN in backdrop of Rain emergency, around 2.2 million people have been directly or indirectly been affected by the flooding with 77,337 houses fully damaged and 137,007 partially damaged in 15,233 villages.  In total, 196 relief camps have been established which are providing shelter to 23,629 people. Additionally, it is estimated that 1.9 million acres of crops have been affected and 45,961 loss of livestock. The Humanitarian Country Team through allocated Pakistan Humanitarian Pooled Fund (PHPF) through reserved allocation has announced to provide urgent humanitarian assistance for rain flood affected communities in four districts of Sindh Province including district of Sanghar and Badin in the sectors of WASH and Food Security.

The proposed project focuses on addressing the emergency WASH needs of 112,975 displaced/affected people. SAFWCO proposed action aims to respond to reduce the mortality and morbidity of flood affected populations through the provision of lifesaving water, sanitation and hygiene related interventions in Taluka Khipro, district of Sanghar and Taluka and District Badin. 

Gender will be mainstreamed all throughout the project cycle. SAFWCO will retain capacity to respond to WASH related crises in Districts of Sanghar and Badin for a maximum of 03 months. Widespread safe hygiene practice education will be provided to women through hygiene promotion session along with sessions on significance of hand washing at Household level with cross cutting awareness on prevention of COVID-19.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pakistan is struggling to contain a 4th wave of delta coronavirus infections, reporting close to 3,752 active cases in the last 24 hours, the highest number of daily infections in nine months during the third wave, The rate of people testing positive for COVID-19 had alarmingly to more than 10% from a low of about 3% a couple weeks ago, suggesting the actual number of infections is likely much higher than the reported cases. The overall number of infections and deaths from COVID-19, In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is 4411, there have been 141495 total cases as of July 23, 2021. The active cases in district Peshawar is 963. In the last 24 hours 510 tests conducted having 72 positive cases in district Peshawar with 14.12% positivity rate. The total test conducted so far is 2271331 as of July 23, 2021 in KP. Total of 75872 vaccine doses have been administered so far in last 24 hours in all categories.
Government imposed a partial COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020 to contain the virus spread. However, the restrictions were neglected, and most people did not follow the SoPs and health guidelines. Large gatherings both religious and political resumed in July, with most people believing the pandemic was over. Moreover, winter is usually a wedding season in Pakistan, and although the government has imposed a ban on large-scale weddings, it is likely that indoor wedding events would continue to take place amid the fourth pandemic wave.
Inadequate health facilities/personnel and low testing capacity is also a big challenge to the Government health services delivery and hospitals are unable to deal with the burden. &quot;Hospitals are already short of beds, Medical and paramedical staff are also getting infected by COVID-19 and no substitute is available to fill the gap. The capacity of health services delivery is slowly decreasing with the COVID-19 patient&#x2019;s flow. The situation is getting worse day by day due to increase in new cases and deaths statistics due to the delta variant virus in different parts of KP, the situation may remain the same for coming some months and another lock down may be impose in the country due to the 4th wave. Furthermore, vaccination is also a big challenge for health department due to multiple rumors and false concept regarding the vaccine, a smaller number of RRT teams, community engagement and support in vaccination is extensively needed to control widespread of the deadly C-19 virus. 
Keeping in view the above situation as per the government and WHO reports, the corona cases are abruptly increased during the 4th wave of the COVID-19 and it is expected that the fourth wave will be more severe if not complement Govt. response on time, the repercussion will be more dangerous and fatal. 
EHSAR had already implemented a COVID-19 project in district Peshawar and Swat with financial support from PHPF during the first and second wave and provided immediate support to government and affected community through essential health services and screening activities. Keeping in view the consistent spread and high ratio of confirmed COVID-19 cases need urgent support to the DoH, District Administration in the most affected district of Peshawar K.P.
Following identified need and gaps through EHSAR need assessment and district Peshawar govt. health department coordination were analyzed, which needs immediate support in COVID-19 fourth wave of the Pandemic.
Gaps Identified: 
1. Tools, Supplies and deployment of 4 number of One Stop PHC COVID-19 Centres
2. Additional infection prevention and control 
3. Community engagement and awareness
4. Community-based delivery of essential health services including MNCH services
5. Strengthen the COVID-19 response in the community
6. Mobile vaccination in the rural areas especially COVID-19 stricken places
7. Provision of Psychosocial and Referral Support</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The pandemic situation of COVID-19, globally affected people and their routine life. To respond the emergency, different initiatives have been taken to provide possible support to people in Pakistan.  The proposed project is basically a supplementary effort to strengthen the fight against COVID-19 as an emergency response to Government of Balochistan. Project interventions are aligned with the strategic priorities of PHPF.

The COVID-19 positivity Rate in Balochistan is 09% as per daily situation report of Provincial COVID-19 Response Cell, GoB.  The project is being proposed based on rigorous consultations with WHO and district health authorities. COVID-19 vaccination is still a challenge for GoB, so mobile COVID-19 vaccination is being proposed through social mobilisation process and a total of 10,000 men and women will be vaccinated through mobile outreach in 12 high risk UCs. 

As per census 2017, the population of district Killa Abdullah was 757,578 (male 397,596 amp female 359,982) and population in the hotspot areas is around 64,000 that includes Chaman Town, Mezai Ada, Murda Karez and Killa Abdullah Town etc. To address gender equality, interventions have been designed for the equal number of men, women, boys and girls including minorities and PWDs. The mobilisation process will address a total of 64,000 individuals (27290 men, 25191 women, adolescent girls 5530 and boys 5990, including 1152 men and women PWDs and 2560 minorities) to create demand for the COVID-19 vaccination. BRSP will provide logistics to the vaccination team and vaccination will be carried out at the doorsteps to the motivated communities.

RRTs and HFFPs will be trained on random RAT and a total of 200 (150 males, 50 female) personnel will be engaged in this process. RAT will be carried out at hotspots in high risk UCs through the logistic support of BRSP. RRTs and HFFPs will also be equipped with necessary safeguards such as thermal guns, protective equipment, N95 masks, goggles/face shields, gloves, sanitisers etc. 

DHQ Hospital will be strengthened through the provision of necessary equipment such as oxygen concentrator, pulse oximeter, oxygen cylinders and folder beds. Furthermore, staff at DHQ Hospital will be trained on Case management by WHO&#x2019;s certified trainer. BRSP will address GBV component as cross cutting theme and will be part and parcel of social mobilisation process. Psychologists will be linked with the GBV victims for psychosocial counselling. Referral pathways will be shared with the beneficiary communities to seek any legal, protection, health, shelter and law enforcement agencies support. During the project period, a total of 5000 men and women will be sensitised on GBV issues, 2500 women on referral pathways and 600 women will be provided psychosocial support and counselling services</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The pandemic of COVID-19 was first notified on 31 December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. COVID-19 pandemic has spread to over 216 countries, and as of 11 August 2021, the number of cases around the world has reached 203 295 170 with 4 303 515 deaths (CFR: 2.10%). COVID-19 reached Pakistan on the 26th of February 2020, spreading countrywide and the first two waves of infection that were observed in June and October 2020 while the third and fourth waves associated with emergence of SARS-CoV2 variants have been documented in April and June-July (ongoing) 2021.

As of 11 August 2021, 1 080 360 cases with  24,085 deaths have been reported, and the country is currently experiencing its fourth wave, with high number of cases and deaths being reported since end June 2021. 

In view of the ongoing widespread community transmission and the recent spread of the newly identified Delta (Indian) variant, a rapid increase in cases has been reported in recent weeks. This poses a serious problem with potential to overwhelm the current limited health sector capacity for confirmation, management and follow up of cases. The current vaccination coverage in Pakistan is only approx. 8% of the total population with variable acceptance and uptake in different provinces and regions. There is need for continued support to the Government in the essential pillars of SPRP 2021 specially surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, and case management with IPC practices, while essential health capacities are fully resumed and maintained.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through a common service platform, implementing partners will jointly administer activities geared at curtailing COVID-19 transmission and fostering community resilience in dealing with the shock of the epidemic.

The combined forces of CCCM and WASH aim to deliver essential COVID-19 risk communication and community engagement activities while establishing necessary water points and handwashing platforms for better hygiene practices.  Moreover, the use of radio media will look to provide an additional layer of awareness and critical thinking related to community-based responses and prevention of COVID-19 transmission.  Partners will continue to forge synergies with organizations, civil society and local authorities operating within targeted IDP sites to greatly strengthen, reinforce and harmonize COVID-19 risk communication and hardware activities that are occurring within Deynile and Hodan IDP sites.

AVORD: Through joint collaboration, AVORD will provide site-level RCCE encapsulating the cluster&#x2019;s RCCE Plan and adapting efforts based on findings from the CCCM Cluster&#x2019;s RCCE Feedback Assessment. Implementation of a site-level complaints feedback mechanism (CFM) will occur with the system adhering to the cluster&#x2019;s standards and following guidelines put forth by the Community Engagement Working Group.

SCC (separate proposal): Through joint collaboration, WASH partners will organize hygiene promotion activities supported by CCCM partner via mobilizing community members and certain targeted members of the IDP site. When feasible, WASH partners will provide of emergency WASH services to IDP sites (water supply, hygiene promotion-installation, of handwashing stations and distribution of soap for hand washing to sites that do not have access these services.

Radio Ergo (contracted): Producing specialized COVID-19 response and prevention information detailing health referral pathways, COVID-19 knowledge, and incorporating radio shows with community members such as religious leaders and Camp Management Committee (CMC) members.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving Access to lifesaving and Sustaining Education , Child Protection and WASH  Services to Flood Affected Children(Boys and Girls) in Jowhar and Mahaday  Districts, Middle Shabelle Region, Hirshabelle State of Somalia.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is designed to respond to education, WASH and protection needs of children affected by floods in seven rural villages of Jowhar District of Middle Shabelle in Hirshabelle State of Somali for six months. The villages have either been affected by floods due to River Shabelle breaking its banks and flooding the settlements and farmlands in the riverine areas or flash floods sweeping the villages as a result of above-normal heavy Hagaa rains experienced in the region. The Guu rains expected between October and December are likely to result further deterioration of the situation.
Education facilities in the targeted villages are closed since most of them were affected either flood from river bank breakage that saw them completely inundated or marooned by water. 
The villages are generally food insecure as the population is faced with acute unemployment, the prohibitive cost of living, and lack of skill sets by majority of the dwellers to eke meaningful living. The situation is further exacerbated by cyclic droughts and flash floods that are making agro-pastoralism lifestyle untenable and thus many are dropping out to join the ever-increasing population of vulnerable persons in the riverine regions. The worst affected are children and women who often bear the brunt of neglect and abandonment during these hard times. This often makes them susceptible to abuses and exploitations such as Gender-Based Violence, sexual exploitation, early marriages, child labor and recruitment to armed groups. 
The project intends to use school attendance as an important preventive factor for child protection, particularly the girl-child. The project will employ such interventions as, training of teachers on basic child protection skills, provision of child-friendly environment through improvement and repair of damaged temporary/ permanent classrooms. Aid Vision will establish and strengthen the capacity of CtC clubs to provide peer interaction forums to learners, provision of teaching and learning materials-including recreational materials, capacity building of CBCPCs to raise awareness on risks of child abuse and enhance children&#x2019;s access and retention at schools. The CBCPCs will contribute to service mapping, identification of referral pathways and disseminate the information about available child protection service for children in the community. CP Focal Points, trained on PSS/PFA, will facilitate structured gender sensitive recreational and PSS activities at the schools for both boys and girls throughout the project live and conduct child safety walk and audit/ /risk mapping exercises with the guidance of project CP supervisor.
To address urgent WASH needs at the schools and ensure continuous learning for 2000 learners, Aid Vision will supply water to 7 schools for 6 months which will be delivered by trucks. Each school will have water storage tank with taps placed at strategic location for easy access. 23 twin gender-sensitive latrines will be constructed at schools that lack sanitation facilities. All latrines will have sufficient water, hand washing facilities and lockable doors for meaningful access. Girls and boys will attend CP awareness sessions to be organized for all schools. This is aimed at ensuring they have preventive skills on violence against children. Girls latrines usage will be monitored and corrective actions taken to address safety concerns. Regular hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on handwashing and safe water handling will be conducted at schools for 14 days to prevent the risk of AWD/Cholera outbreak. Hygiene promotion sessions will follow where schools&#x2019; health clubs will disseminate messages on good hygiene practices at schools. To ensure schools have sustained access to water 2 shallow wells damaged by floods will be rehabilitated and protected with hand-pumps. 9 manually operated hand-free hand washing stations will be installed and soap for hand washing provided to reduce risk/transmission of COVID-19.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As part of the global capacity support to the FGS in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC) has received a request from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) to provide two 350 KVA generators in strengthening the functioning of the De Martino and Benadir Hospitals and the National Testing Laboratory. The appeal to the United Nations for support is a matter of urgency as those two referral facilities are facing a dire need to keep power stability while treating and testing patients with COVID-19.  
The RC/HC has decided to use the Humanitarian response funds to finance the support and requested UNDP to handle the procurement process to provide the generators. From the quotations already sought by the OPM, the estimate cost for the two generators is USD 160,000 including delivery and installation. UNDP is currently launching its own competitive sourcing to come up with financial proposals for contracting the supplier with the best value for money. Before a contract is signed, a budget should be available in Atlas, hence this submission in GMS to secure funding.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The current triple effects of floods, locust infestation and COVID-19 Pandemic coupled with heavy rains in the Ethiopian highlands have led to increasing water levels in the Shabelle and Juba rivers in southern Somalia, causing widespread flooding in low-lying riverine communities and displacing more than 270,000 people out of their homes, The project is in line with Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF) Reserve and will provide integrated life-saving emergency primary health care and nutrition needs of flood-affected women, men, boys and girls of proposed project targets in Jowhar district. ARD is proposing  6-month integrated Health and Nutrition project targeting flood affected populations in Jowhar district reaching a total of 14,600  persons including 2,950 women, 2,180 Men, 5,025 boys and 4,445 girls) 
HEALTH: The proposed project will support two mobile (IERT) in Jowhar district. ARD plans to deliver an integrated package of promotive, preventive and curative maternal, newborn amp child health services and scale-up outbreak early warning and response (EWAR) and case management of epidemic prone diseases through IERT response team as part of the efforts to support the flood affected communities in Jowhar. The project aims to establish mobile clinics in Jowhar IDP and host community&#x2019;s sites and scale up the health care through skilled health professionals. ARD through this project will provide regular medical supplies and life-saving drugs to established health facilities, establish referral mechanisms and   improve the coverage of measles vaccinations, support safe motherhood and reproductive health while also ensuring readiness to prevent and respond to outbreaks such as malaria, measles or AWD/Cholera and promote health update through health education and beneficiary sensitization
NUTRITION: The proposed nutrition activities will be integrated with the health interventions with the aim of addressing underlying causes of high levels malnutrition as well as to enable early identification of SAM cases for treatment in 2 mobile and 1 fixed OTPs and 1 SC) in targeted IDPs and host community in the floods affected areas in Jowhar district. This program will establish a strong community network through competent community nutrition volunteers for early detection/case finding and referral of children and pregnant and lactating mothers with acute malnutrition. In addition to the treatment of acute malnutrition, the project will be promoting positive infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practice by providing IYCF promotion and counselling. ARD is strong partner for the nutrition cluster and therefore, will have close coordination with other partners in the district for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses. Through this project, a total 12,420(2,950 women, 5,025 girls and 4,445 boys) floods affected individuals in Jowhar will have access to a package of Emergency lifesaving integrated health and nutrition services in six months&#x2019; period. The mobile team will provide comprehensive community screening, identification, treatment  and referral services from community, IDP areas to the fixed outpatient therapeutic program(OTP) and Stabilization Center (SC) to improve access to the integrated package for the vulnerable community prioritizing rapid referral of the most critical cases (priority will be given to under 5 children and pregnant and lactating women), it shall also capacity building of nutrition staff on IMAM/IYCF services, infant young child feeding best practices (IYCF.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of integrated specialized child protection and GBV services for boys, girls and women affected by floods in Balcad  Jowhar districts of Middle Shabelle region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the growing humanitarian crisis in southern Somalia SOS CVS is proposing the following interventions to expand lifesaving Child protection and GBV services to vulnerable populations in two districts in middle Shabelle region. SOS CVS will support the most deprived children, women and girls in IDP camps, those affected by emergencies, crisis and displacements, those at risk of family separation as well as victims of gender based violence whose vulnerability increases due to breakdown in community structures. The project will be implemented in two districts in Middle Shabelle region (Balcad and Jowhar)

The main objective of the proposed integrated protection project is to improve the protection of the targeted children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation in the target area. The  integrated protection emergency response  is designed to improve the protection of the target children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation through provision of psychosocial and mental health support  and provide rapid identification, tracing and family reunification services for those at risk of family separations. In addition to this, unaccompanied and separated children in the intervention targeted IDPs will be reunified with their caregivers/guardians and those children who do not have caregivers/guardians will be supported through community based (clan/kafala) foster care placements.  Through existing Community Protection Committees (CPC), provide a platform to establish community&#xAC; based child protection mechanisms (CBCPMs) to facilitate the identification of and response to child protection concerns, the development of community&#xAC; based mitigation plans, prevention messaging (e.g. on forced recruitment) and child protection surveillance mechanisms. 

The project propose to create CFS at community level that will provide psychosocial and recreational support through structured and age appropriate group and individual activities including recreation, skill building and basic learning activities. The proposed CFS will also provide children with a protective and conducive environment to play socialize and learn to express themselves.  In addition, the project will provide psychosocial and parenting activities to both IDPS and host communities and their caregivers. The project will provide community-based PSS and resilience activities aimed towards coping and strengthening protective environment for children and their parents. Child right groups will be established at community level and provide psychosocial support (PSS) workshops (MHPSS) services to key targeted beneficiaries in view of increasing child resilience in IDP and surrounding communities. This will be conducted in the CFS centers at the community level.
The project will also carry out community based mapping to identify safety risk for children and provide  insight into what issues exist and better understanding of how issues connect to each other and plan for mitigation to support the identified risk.

The project is also designed to increase women and adolescent girls access to life saving prevention and response measures through providing GBV services, case management, PSS counselling to traumatized GBV survivors to reduce risk of GBV at target districts.  To provide timely, effective and efficient GBV responses, the proposed project will train health workers and caseworkers in CM and CMR of rape survivors.  Community based GBV volunteers will be trained to conduct GBV services awareness campaign. This will offer an opportunity to provide much needed response services in the target areas that are without GBV and protection services.  

Finally the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and CP AoR approved IEC risk communication and print it in local language as well general awareness child protection prevention messages.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to provide emergency shelter (ESK) and basic household items (NFIs) to 1,120 flood affected persons (1,504 men,  2,259 women, 1,508 girls and 1,449  boys) ii Balcad districts of Middle Shabelle Region.In line with the Shelter cluster guidelines and recommendation on response to the recent flooding in parts of Lower, Middle Shabelle and Hiraan regions, Mercy Corps will prioritize and target, the recent flooding displaced new IDPs and IDPs in protracted situation affected by the recent floods.   

These IDPs are currently residing in rural, peri-urban and urban informal crowded settlements, with insufficient access to basic services and poor shelter conditions that raise protection and health concerns. They remain in need of Shelter and NFIs support for protection from the current harsh climatic conditions, overall improvements to their living conditions and improvement to their chances to access livelihoods and durable solutions. On the other hand, Mercy Corps will target poor  host Communities households - to ensure peaceful coexistence between the local population and target groups and also because many of them are equally vulnerable and in need of humanitarian assistance. Mercy Corps will conduct direct distribution in line with the Shelter cluster minimum standards.

Mercy Corps will also where applicable use  other donor funded grants to compliment this Shelter response project to ensure sufficient support to the targeted vulnerable populations including where possible livelihood and WASH  interventions to the targeted participants thereby cushioning the affected HHs against the COVID 19 pandemic and to limit impact on livelihoods or negative coping strategies.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through a common service platform, implementing partners will jointly administer activities geared at curtailing COVID-19 transmission and fostering community resilience in dealing with the shock of this epidemic. The combined forces of CCCM and WASH aim to deliver essential COVID-19 risk communication and community engagement activities while establishing necessary water points and handwashing platforms for better hygiene practices.  Moreover, the use of radio media will look to provide an additional layer of awareness and critical thinking related to community-based responses and prevention of COVID-19 transmission.  Partners will continue to forge synergies with organizations, civil society, and local authorities operating within targeted IDP sites to greatly strengthen, reinforce and harmonize COVID-19 risk communication and hardware activities that are occurring within Deynile and Hodan IDP sites. AVORD: Through joint collaboration, AVORD will provide site-level RCCE encapsulating the cluster&#x2019;s RCCE Plan and adapting efforts based on findings from the CCCM Cluster&#x2019;s RCCE Feedback Assessment. Implementation of a site-level complaints feedback mechanism (CFM) will occur with the system adhering to the cluster&#x2019;s standards and following guidelines put forth by the Community Engagement Working Group. SCC (separate proposal): Through joint collaboration, SCC will be working WASH partners to organize hygiene promotion activities supported by CCCM partners via mobilizing community members and certain targeted members of the IDP sites. When feasible, WASH partners will provide emergency WASH services to IDP sites (water supply, hygiene promotion-installation, of handwashing stations, and distribution of soap for handwashing to sites that do not have access to these services. Radio Ergo (contracted): Producing specialized COVID-19 response and prevention information detailing health referral pathways, COVID-19 knowledge, and incorporating radio shows with community members such as religious leaders and Camp Management Committee (CMC) members.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Durable and Sustainable access to water, improved sanitation and hygiene to flood  vulnerable and marginalised and flood &#x2013;displaced communities in Balcad District</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Humanitarian situation in Middle Shabelle has deteriorated due ongoing flooding in last two consecutive rainy seasons and now communities in low lying areas along the Juba and Shabelle river valleys in south central Somalia are grappling with a new wave of flooding during Hagaa season due to the intensive rains started within the Ethiopian highlands. The worst affected districts by floods are Balcad, Jowhar and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn distr icts in Lower Shabelle (South West State) and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 per cent of the displacement has occurred. The flooding situation in Balcad district has resulted in massive displacement affecting particularly children, mothers and the elderly who are now facing serious hunger, health and protection risks in an area already receiving little to no humanitarian assistance due to insecurity. The floods have destroyed food reserves and threatened food markets. Significant gaps have been reported in flood-affected areas regarding to food, emergency shelter, non-food items, and safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. Mothers, children, and the elderly as well as disabled people are extra affected due to the fact that displacement puts them at risk of exploitation since they lack their normal income routines and familiar environment. People are at a high risk of hunger and illness such as water-borne diseases which has already been reported in some of the flood affected areas. The impact of the ongoing flooding in Hirshabelle compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The proposed project aims to save the lives of affected communities in Balcad district and enhance resilience building by provide safe, equitable and sustainable access to safe and sufficient water for drinking, cooking, personal, and domestic (15L/p/day) through by drilling and construction of 1 borehole and rehabilitation of 3 boreholes and 5 shallow wells, construction of 100 flood proof latrines that consider the disable people, distribution of hygiene and sanitation kits to improve sanitation conditions and establishment and train water management committees to the operation and maintenance of the facilities. The project will target the most vulnerable households (men, women boys and girls) affected  differently by the ongoing floods but give special attention to female-headed households, the  elderly and people living with disability. Market-based programming (MBP) will be considered in all the activities to strengthen and working with existing markets supply chains and service providers in project target areas to meet the needs of crisis-affected populations.GSA has extensive experience of working in the WASH sector within Balcad district and can mobilize rapidly due to strong links with communities and government.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The impact of the ongoing flooding compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 escalated conflict, and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods temporarily displaced households to higher grounds in several prone areas including Belet Weyne. The recurrent floods have inundated the roads, WASH infrastructures, crops, houses and etc. A cholera outbreak fueled by limited access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, and displacement has already been reported in some of the flood-affected districts, underscoring the need for urgent repair and rehabilitation to damaged WASH infrastructure and the provision of clean water. More cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) are being reported in children under five years old, who are particularly vulnerable to disease, especially if their immune systems are compromised by malnutrition. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in the Belet Weyne town and 9 villages in Belet Weyne district to 19,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved communities. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project the following WASH services:
Water:
- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) 
- Rehabilitation/construction of 29 flood-damaged shallow wells with hand pumps.
- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 29 WASH committees and 58 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting

Hygiene and Sanitation:
Lack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people&#x2019;s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. never the less, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: 

- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 19,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers, and feeding centers 
-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out 
-Distribute of 1,000 HP kits to 1,000 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and
- Construct 263 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines for the most affected community including latrines for disabled people in ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2019, COVID-19 emerged, and the WHO has declared its outbreak as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has resulted in a great disruption to education worldwide. Education has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with 1.53 billion learners out of school and 184 country-wide school closures, impacting 87.6% of the world&#x2019;s total enrolled learners. Drop-out rates across the globe are likely to rise as a result of this massive disruption to education access. Thus, the Somali Government took precautionary measures as stopping international flights, closing learning institutions, and banning large public gathers. As the Government continues to monitor the situation, CISP plans to mitigate and minimize the impact of school closure and interrupted student learning, particularly for the most vulnerable. As there is a lack of clarity on how the COVID-19 situation will evolve globally and locally in Somalia, CISP will forecast long-term contingency measures ensuring that the impact of COVID-19 on students will be addressed as schools remain closed. In Somalia, it has affected learning and forced the closure of learning institutions including schools and universities since March 18th, 2020. In responding to this outbreak, CISP adapts the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Higher Education (MoECHE) strategy on COVID-19 preparedness and response. 
The proposed 9-month intervention will target 12 schools with an enrolment of 3462 learners with the provision of food, TLM, and Dignity kit while 19,890 adults and children of school-going age children will be targeted with radio PSA and health messages to provide mitigation measures on the impact of COVID-19 on top of other existing challenges such as conflict, drought and desert locust for learners both school holidays and when schools reopen. The project will improve access to critical WASH inputs, emergency food for students to meet their food and energy needs, payment of emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, provision of teaching and learning materials (TLM). Specific WASH activities will include the distribution of handwashing soaps, liquid detergents, rehabilitation of latrines, provision of storage water tanks, water trucking for schools with no constant water supply, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. Following the Federal guideline on social distancing CISP will work with the ministry of health and MoECHE to explore the possibility of having smaller groups of teacher and CEC&#x2019;s to train so as to maintain 1.5-meter distance in order to implement a lifesaving training of hygiene and Sanitation on preparedness, mitigation and response to COVID-19 pandemic and identification of COVID-19 symptoms to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the school community. CISP proposes this project to improve access to quality education and making schools child-friendly for COVID-19, drought and conflict-affected communities, and host community children Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. The project directly addresses the educational needs of both the displaced and host community children. This project will create a protective environment for children through the improvement of hygiene/sanitation in schools thereby making schools learner-friendly and also the provision of quality education through providing learning resources, general community sensitization through radio PSA will be aired through Galmudug radio station on the COVID-19 pandemic awareness and prevention.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed 11 months intervention will improve access to quality education and increase access to critical WASH inputs and IEC material for prevention of COVID-19  in 16 IDP schools of conflict-affected IDP students and their surrounding communities in Mudug region of Puntland State of Somalia. 

Relief International (RI) is already implementing an SHF funded project in 6 IDP schools in Mudug continuing until mid-May 2020. Under the proposed project, support will be extended to these 6 schools for an extended period while 10 more IDP schools will be added to ensure access to more IDPs children and to cover the educational needs of existing children in Galkacyo district. The project will target 3,893 enrolled children (1,892 boys and 2,001 girls). 

Education specific activities with inclusion of COVID-19 response  will include the provision of education supplies based on the minimum standards of education cluster emergency take-away food rations with inclusion of soap for students to meet student&#x2019;s minimum caloric needs and to better hygiene practices emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers sanitary kits with soap for adolescent girls to encourage their regular attendance at school once school are open in new academic year based on  and teacher training on INEE/TICC with adding contents of PSS and inclusive education. these training will be conducted on safe opening of schools. however, measures will be in place to stop the spread of COVID-19. The measures will include, arranging training in small groups, availability of sanitizer/soap and masks at training venue, a session at the start of training to brief the participants for maintaining social distancing. 
Specific WASH activities in schools will include increasing schools&#x2019; water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, rehabilitation of latrines and construction of water storage tanks. Child- and gender-friendly latrines in the targeted schools will be rehabilitated or, where necessary, constructed to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. Hand washing facilities will be constructed in schools. The project will provide hand washing soap when schools reopen. The schools will also be provided with posters with vital information on hygiene but also other thematic areas that may be relevant to COVID 19 as they reopen. Where possible, murals will be developed in strategic places to further enhance the communication
   . A refresher training will be arranged for CECs with the addition of new contents related to psychosocial first aid, hygiene promotion, and prevention of COVID-19, school improvement plans, and child protection along with the refresher of previously covered content. RI will also integrate child protection in different trainings with CECs and teachers. Focus will also be given on developing messages for child protection and  positive parenting. Through CECs, RI will deliver messages to schools and communities on key protection concerns affecting the community. These messages will target prevention as well as the response in the event protection incidents arise. 

RI will coordinate a back-to-school campaign with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on girls and children affected by displacement and to ensure that children are back to school and COVID-19 break Parents of respective communities will also be trained on psychosocial first aid and child protection.</narrative>

Destruction of school infrastructure was largely reported by the Joint Xudur Mission that included the cluster and regional parters (Inter-Agency Rapid Needs Assessment Report for IDPs and Vulnerable Host Community in Xudur town, Bakool region-Somalia 4-6 February 2019). The floods displaced learners and teachers, destroyed infrastructure and learning materials and left the residents with the risk of cholera/AWD. Abuses such as recruitment of children into militias have been reported by a number of agencies all of which gravely affect learning processes.
This project is designed to reach IDP children of school going ages in Holwadag Primary School, Misnagato IDP school, Wariri IDP School, Bakaro Yarey IDP School, Madhayto IDP school, Awdinle Primary School in Baidoa Mama Gedia, Bulow primary, Shodog primary school in Xudur and Bardaale primary school, Abubakar, Aldarein primary school, Abuhureyra, Al-Ahli and Sheikh Hamud school in Berdale all of which are in Bay and Bakool to
1) Provide immediate education and hygiene response services integrated with activities and services in response to covid-19 prevention for the most vulnerable children through provision of basic school supplies while focusing on rehabilitation of infrastructure for school damaged by floods in Xudur.
2) Increase resilience through the provision of basic education and hygiene trainings in INEE/TiCC for teachers and school management for CECs to support school-based resilience mechanisms that will contribute to the sustainability of education programs
3) Build the capacities of teachers and CECs to better respond to child protection issues and Covid-19 prevention issues as per Integrated Education and Child Protection response framework and in line with WHO guidelines on Covid-19 response.
The project targets 15 primary schools in Bay and Bakool region affected by the protracted crisis and floods in South West State. READO in response to emergency-affected learners has proposed this project to mainly retain 4684 learners (2096 girls) and 35 teachers (11 female) and 24 CECs (12 female) at school in mitigating the case of high school dropout rate following effects of prolonged drought and floods. The project will focus on the provision of quality learning opportunities through
 Provision of quality Teaching, g and Learning and Hygiene Materials in 15 public primary schools
 Water provision to 15 schools and complimentary food provision in 5 public primary schools in rural Baidoa aimed at improving the quality of learning by contributing to physical and mental growth of learners.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustaining Life-Saving Support for Identified Vulnerable Households in Adado District</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The planned FSL project intervention is cluster specific response conforms to the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2020 and the 1st 2020 SHF Standard Allocation for the Food Security and Livelihood as it applies to project planned target District of Adado (South Mudug Region). The project will provide lifesaving support to 750 HHs assessed to be in acute food insecurity, &#x2018;Crisis&#x2019; phase of IPC (3)  by providing them with a means to sustained access to food and safety net support. The 750 beneficiaries will receive UCT amounting to a food transfer value of US $100 for 4 months to support a food purchase that meet the minimum 2100 kcal/person/day.

The project proposes lifesaving interventions that are gender sensitive, adapt centrality of protection and that mainstream gender and protection in the delivery methods proposed. The project will specifically prioritize destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the Adado Districts) and other households as identified in the Adado District that fall into the IPC 3. The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the poor recovery from the 2016-17 drought that were followed by below average Deyr 2018 and Gu 2019 season rains in Central Somalia Region. The project will also support the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from Haradhere District who have sought refuge in Adado District after being displaced by the Non-State Actors keen on forcibly recruiting the children (boys) to be trained in their militia and also being forced to part with their animals on what amounts to illegal taxation for the Zakaat.

The project seeks to improve households&#x2019; immediate access to food to 750 vulnerable households in Adado District of Galgadud Region through Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCTs) for 4 months.  The project will undertake a vulnerability assessment in selected locations of the targeted 6 locations in the District (3 settlements with IDPs and 3 settlements with high number of vulnerable host households) with the findings being used in developing the criteria for selection of the planned UCT beneficiaries and informing on protection needs.  Priority for the UCTs beneficiaries will be given to women-led households from the most vulnerable among recently displaced and socially marginalized communities in the District. The UCTs planning will also be supported by a market analysis undertaken in the District (undertaken by the FSL Team) to determine the capacity of local markets to absorb the resources extended to the beneficiaries. 

The project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure that the project gets feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and arising gaps that will require humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible effects of the locusts that are expected to spawn again with the coming Gu 2019 season. In addition the project will monitor the trends of COVID-19 pandemic and support groups that may be at risk of a lockdown in case of an increase in food prices given the interruption of supply chains as will be authoritatively captured authoritatively captured by WFP Somalia in its Supply chain monitoring briefs.  The project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular helps make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them. The project will also ensure there is adequate protection of women in all the venues and staging points of the project to ensure it provides the women safety and protection require</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Communicable diseases specifically for children under five and women is a major contributor to maternal and child mortality and morbidity among the populations in humanitarian crisis in Jalalaqsi. Access to basic primary healthcare  services is severely constrained due  to funding gaps that has resulted in in very few health facilities functioning.The proposed project aims at scaling up primary health services in two health centers managed by ZamZam. Services provided at the health centers will be based on the EPHS standards for Somalia.The health facilities will be strengthened to provide  MPHSS services and CMR for GBV survivors. Existing staff will be trained and re-deployed. Essential health supplies will be procured  and made available in the supported sites.To take services closer to the rural villages and undeserved populations,the project will also operationalize one well equipped mobile health unit that will visit 11 villages.The unit will be attached to one of the health centers and will provide  emergency health services five days a week.The mobile health unit will provide immunization for children under one,treat common illnesses using IMNCI strategy,focused antenatal care,postnatal care,education and awareness on common illnesses and malnutrition among other important actions. One  ambulance will be hired to support referral of children with danger signs and obstetric emergencies.In total ,40600 persons among them 1624 children under one,8120 children under five and 3654 pregnant and lactating women are expected to directly access health services through the planned intervention.The project will be integrated with other complementary interventions implemented by ZamZam as well as other organizations working in the region. ZamZam is already running CMAM program which will easily integrate with the planned project.Quality assurance measures including quarterly joint support supervisions,data quality checks and continuous monitoring visits will be prioritized.In addition, community health promotion activities will also included public health messages on COVID-19 risks of outbreak in Somalia. In addition, ZAMZAM will scale up COVID-19 Risk communication and Community engagement:
1. Training of Health workers on implementation of standard Infection prevention and control guidelines of COVID 19
2. Dissemination of COVID-19 prevention and control messages from local FM radio in Hiran with 3 prime time spots for morning ,afternoon and evenings.
3. Print and disseminate IEC materials developed by MOH/WHO to health facilities and communities

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Health and Nutrition services through support for fixed facilities and mobile outreach through the Integrated Emergency Response Teams (IERTs)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project has been developed in line with the Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and the health and nutrition cluster strategic objectives of providing integrated lifesaving health and nutrition services for the cluster priority districts in Nugaal regions i.e. Garowe districts. It is also contributing to the cluster priority of filling critical gaps in health care services for populations facing high incidence of malnutrition and service gaps.
The project has also been designed with full awareness of the prevailing gender norms and deeply rooted gender inequalities in Somalia that limit women and girls from accessing basic services such as health and nutrition, and expose them to a higher risk of GBV. In order to address these challenges, Save the Children will identify and work to remove the physical, cognitive and social barriers by collaborating closely with the communities and particularly the influencers and gatekeepers. We will also address the intersectionality of vulnerability factors, for example women with disabilities or from minor clans who are likely to face multiple levels of discrimination.
The project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health and nutrition services through the support of static health facilities complemented by mobile outreach services. There will be one integrated health and nutrition mobile team in Garowe district. The integrated health and nutrition mobile team will provide outpatient consultations, routine immunizations, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi&#xFB01;cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to out-patient therapeutic programme (OTP), Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) and stabilization centers. The provision of OTP services for those with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and the referral and treatment of SAM cases with medical complications to the nearest stabilization centre. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices, promotion of adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be done, providing treatment for all age groups, both male and female. The health and nutrition interventions will improve early identification and prevention of malnutrition, and access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. As part of gender and social norms transformation we will ensure that the activities include positive messaging for men in their roles as fathers. Women and girls will be seen by health practitioners of the same sex and consultations and documentation will be kept confidential.
Save the Children (SC) will support nine fixed facilities in the following locations Waabari MCH, Gabmbool MCH, Gargar MCH, Jilab MCH, Barwaaqo MCH,Bahnano 1 MCH, Bahnano 2 MCH, Hanano MCH and Awrculus MCH    with integrated health and nutrition services in addition to the mobile and iCCM services. SC will carry out regular safety audits of the facilities to identify and mitigate the risks faced by women and girls in accessing services and resources.
We would like to note that Save the Children is working closely with partners to monitor and respond to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic and will plan to modify and adapt programme activities according to the emerging situation if necessary. Save the Children will be considering the four following dimensions and is currently developing plans for staff health, business continuity, programme preparedness and programme response.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of life-saving emergency shelter kits and NFIs to vulnerable populations with a focus on newly displaced and protracted  IDPs, and affected IDP hosts in Dollow, Luuq, and Garbaharey Gedo Region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project seeks to provide lifesaving assistance to 3954 HH (Boys=4744, Girls=7118, women=7828, Men=4034) in Gedo region (Dollow, Luuq and Garbaharrey) through the distribution of Non-food Items (NFIs) and Emergency Shelter Kits (ESK). They will be distributed to newly arrived IDPs, protracted IDPs and affected host who did not receive any assistance in 2019 or early 2020 and mainly affected by flood. The target population (women, girls, men, boys, elderly and people with disabilities) living in the IDP site reside in small makeshift structures made of sub-standard materials that jeopardize their physical security, privacy, and from vagaries of nature and diseases. 

Under this project, HAPEN will distribute 3954 NFIs and 3954 ESKs as in-kind to 9 IDP site in Gedo region Dollow: (Kabasa = 655, Qansahley = 550, Host 100), Luuq: Jazeera =314, Xero kowad= 470 and Boyle=420 Host =100), and Garbahrey: (Towfiq =270, Tula qorah =345, Hashi Weer =380, Tafta taag =250 and Host 100).

Beneficiaries will be selected through a participatory process driven by a representative project and site management committees while ensuring marginalized groups interests are catered for and vulnerable approach, considering issues such as women-headed and child-headed households, orphans, disabled, the old among and new arrivals, protracted, and distribution.

The proposed intervention targets 3654 IDP HHs (21,924 IDP persons) and 300 IDP host HHs (1,800) in Dollow, Garbaharey and Luuq. The protracted IDPs targeted are those living in Grabahrey. These families belong to most vulnerable IDPs who live in makeshift buuls without adequate access to NFIs and Emergency Shelter. 

Following a need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries and on local market conditions, HAPEN will facilitate a direct-distribution program through which targeted IDPs and select host communities will receive ESKs and NFIs. HAPEN will employ an owner-driven approach in the construction of emergency shelters by capacitating the IDPs to undertake the construction process.

Protection and GBV concerns will be factored during site selection and will be integrated in all aspects of the response. Proper site planning will be undertaken to ensure effective mitigation of hazards and reduce alarming congestion levels in target settlements.

On monitoring and evaluation, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution and construction respectively. Therefore, two PDM exercises will be conducted for the two phases of NFI distributions. The monitoring exercise will provide beneficiary feedback on the effectiveness and collate lessons of the distribution. 90% of the beneficiaries will take part in the exercise to ensure proper representation and accurate reflection on the process and quality of the intervention. 

The PDM will support measuring beneficiary satisfaction of the items distributed and identify the needs and feelings of the community better. The exercises will inform on the effectiveness of the activities and achievements of targets while providing guidance towards the overall objective. 

3 Community Response and Feedback Mechanism (CRFM) desks, one for each district of operation will be established, in addition to the hotline and PDM /PCM. COVID-19 preventative mechanisms will be adopted in CRFM and during distribution to minimize any occurrence of infections.

The desks will be manned by two personnel and the anticipated data to be collected include among others both compliments and complaints: the quality of the ESKs and NFIs, beneficiary selection processes, shortness of items distributed, delays and other unexpected feedback. HAPEN&#x2019;s staff will analyze the collected data and respond accordingly. This will ensure that community participation and AAP are enhanced.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing the emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP Families (13,296 persons) in Afgoye and Marka districts of Lower Shabelle region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is intended to address the emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 persons) of newly conflict and flood affected population as well as the most vulnerable protracted IDP families for life-saving in both districts &#x2013; Afgoye and Marka &#x2013; Lower Shabelle region.  With the presence of the Somali National Army (SNA) and AMISOM, Al Shabab, and clan militia, the security situation in the region had become more volatile than it was before. Security operations carry out by SNA and AMISOM alongside the USA drone airstrike targeting Alshabaab Militia caused humanitarian consequences to the civilians in the region. Within March 2020, joint forces SNA/AMISOM took over Janale village as a strategic business center it is about 13KM to Marka district. As a result, an estimated number of 3,200 HHs mainly women, children, and elderly people have fled from Janale to the IDPs in Marka, Afgoye villages as well as Mogadishu to escape from the violence. 
Thus, based on findings from rapid needs assessment through direct surveys of IDPs in Marka villages and telephone interviews with IDPs in Afgoye villages conducted by HINNA team in the region, this project is assigned to address emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 people) of the newly conflict and flood affected population including those protracted IDP families who have recently received any shelter and NFIs assistance in 10 IDP sites in the areas with high severity and people in need &#x2013; 5 in Afgoye namely Aytire, Baalguri, Damaley, Sagaalaad, and Mareereey and 5 in Marka namely Buulo Samoow, Buufoow Bacaad, Moallin Ali, Abukar Same, and Cell Fareey who are in dire need of shelter and NFIs assistance as they live in bushes that endanger their lives and dignity. During beneficiary registration, the project will give more priority to most vulnerable and marginalized groups such as IDPs with larger families, families with disabled and elderly persons, female headed-households and etc.
Although markets in both districts are functioning the main challenge is that IDP settlements are far from them. However, according to the preference of project target IDP community including existing camp management committees, camp leaders and local authorities who participated in consultation meeting conducted through direct observation and phone interviews about the modality of assistance, this project will use in-kind distribution modality of 2,216 ESKs and 2,216 NFIs to project direct target beneficiaries of 2,216 HHs (13,296 persons) in both districts. In the context of COVID 19, decongestion and site planning/rearranging shelters will be considered in consultation with IDP communities and in close coordination with the cluster. 
During the implementation, the project will ensure using cluster guidelines to improve the living condition of the targeted beneficiaries by restoring their privacy, protection, and dignity. Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) will be conducted four to six weeks after to assess the quality of the distribution and process, utilization, and its immediate impact in saving lives and the satisfaction of beneficiaries about the NFI items distributed and/or the shelters constructed and it&apos;s quality. This will help us know more about the future preference of IDP communities.
The main objective of the project is to ensure that 13,296 persons (2,216 HHs) of newly displaced, and protracted IDPs affected by conflict and natural disasters have the protection from the weather and have privacy through the provision of 2,216 Emergency Shelter (ESKs) and 2,216 NFI kits to 2,216 households (13,296 persons: (1,728 men, 2,925 women, 3,324 boys, and 5,319 girls)). The project will ensure full coordination among humanitarian service provides especially shelter cluster partners who are working in the project areas in order to avoid duplications.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improved Immediate Access to Food for Vulnerable IDPs in Dayniile District, Mogadishu in Banadir Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The planned FSL project intervention will support targeted cluster-specific priorities that conform to the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2021 and the 2nd SHF 2021 Reserve Allocation round for Food Security and Livelihoods. The project will support 12,960 people (2,160 IDP HHs) in Dayniile District in Mogadishu, Banadir Region assessed to be in acute food insecurity, &#x2018;Crisis&#x2019; and &#x2018;Emergency&#x2019; phases of IPC 3 and 4, through Unconditional Cash Transfers at the multipurpose rate of $60/HH/Month as per CWG&#x2019;s recommended food transfer value (100%) for Banadir of the food MEB. This will provide the target persons with immediate access to food in order to cushion them from hunger, reduce/prevent malnutrition and any potential mortalities. 

The 2,160HHs will be registered from the health/nutrition centres within the IDP camps, based on their malnutrition levels as shown by the MUAC, and then in consideration of other indicative vulnerabilities such as households led by women/children, households with abandoned children, households with economically deprived widows/orphans and households with lone elders, disabled and sickly persons. The Households will receive unconditional cash relief for Four (4) consecutive months and thereafter improvement in the conditions of beneficiaries monitored constantly by health/nutrition staffs at the selected centres to continuously screen children of the targeted HHs to know any improvement on their malnutrition levels and concluded with a Post Distribution Monitoring at the final project Month. 

The Project target locations include the following IDP camps in Dayniile Al cadaala, Al-khayrat, Aala-fuuto, Barwaaqo, Buulo Warbo, Cawle, Ciid, Ciiltire, Danwadaag, Dhiblawe, Dhawaxweyn, Durdur, Fareey, Golweyn, Gorgor, Halgan, Iskaashi, Kalamashawrto, Kulmis, Makka iyo Madiino, Manaas, Marwo, Maslax, Sabiid, Tiyeglow, Warta nabadda amp Xusni.

CPD plans to use the first one month of the 5-months&#x2019; project period to undertake Food Consumption Score Survey, community engagement, beneficiary selection, verification and registration as well as procurement of the services of Mobile Money Transfer Company (Hormuud&apos;s EVC). The beneficiary selection will be done through a Community-Based Target process (CBT) as recommended by the Somalia Cash Working Group (CWG). 

The next 3 months will be used for UCTs to the identified 2,155 HHs while the fifth month will be used for PDM and the final round of the Food Consumption Score Survey. The comparison of the two Food Consumption surveys will help indicate the improvement in access to food for the households According to the FCS&apos;s value, indicating the change in the percentage of households with &#x201C;poor&#x201D; FCS (0-21 scores), &#x201C;borderline&#x201D; FCS (21,5 - 35 scores) and &#x201C;acceptable&#x201D; FCS (35,5 scores and above). The UCTs to the 2,155 HH would be done through Hormuud Mobile Money Transfer (EVC) since it has wide coverage in the target areas and most of the target beneficiaries subscribe to it.

The project will also provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and emerging gaps that will require a humanitarian response. The project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular, make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries. Covid-19 preventive measures and health guidelines will also be mainstreamed in the project implementation. 

CPD has previously implemented several projects in the target project area of Dayniile, the most recent of which was funded by SHF and GAC-Canada and has immense knowledge of the project target area. CPD currently manages a hybrid-powered (solar and Genset) borehole (N 2&#x2019;&#x2019; 03.804, E 45&#x2019;&#x2019; 14.954) in Kahda which neighbours Dayniile, drilled in 2013 by CPD providing free water to the nearby IDP communities.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Against the backdrop of floods that have worsened the humanitarian conditions in Belet Weyne, AVORD is submitting this proposal to contribute to improved living conditions while building resilience to future shocks. The target group will be carefully selected from 36 IDP settlements in Belet Weyne that host protracted and newly arrived IDPs in overcrowded settlements at-risk of COVID-19 outbreak and will include 9,000 men, 12,000 women, 4500 boys and 4,500 girls. Special priority will be accorded to households in deplorable shelter conditions, those who have lost household items and shelter during recent floods, persons with disabilities, female headed households and people from marginalized groups. Tentative list of target settlements in Belet Weyne along with the population per settlement and GPS coordinates are attached to the proposal. AVORD will continuously assess needs throughout the project duration to ensure that relief items are disbursed based on need, and that the most vulnerable site are always targeted.

Proposed activities have been designed in close coordination with humanitarian actors and community leaders in Belet Weyne. While AVORD will be working on the provision of Non-Food Items and emergency shelters, synergies will be established with other interventions implemented by CESDO, SOYDA, LRRDO and JF in the target area to ensure that target beneficiaries receive complementary services from various agencies. For example, protection cases identified during shelter activities will be referred to SOYDA for further support, while households exposed to protection risks due to the lack of shelter as identified by SOYDA will be referred to AVORD for appropriate shelter support. 

Under the proposed initiative, AVORD will distribute 5,000 kit-based Non-Food Items (NFIs) to 5,000 households in Belet Weyne (Approx. 30,000 persons). In-line with shelter cluster standards, each NFI kits will contain core items such as 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 double Mosquito Net, 1 Solar torch and 2 Jerrycan with the capacity of 10 liters each. Disbursement of relief items will be need-based, and will be decided in close coordination with the Shelter Cluster to ensure that available stocks are used to respond to crisis and that activities contribute to the attainment of cluster strategic objectives. Full beneficiary details including name, settlement and contact information will be captured to facilitate monitoring activities and ensure that aid is given to those in need. A Post Distribution Monitoring Exercise (PDM) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and document lessons learnt.

250 households at increased protection risks will receive emergency shelters in addition to NFIs. Site planning will be an integral part of the shelter development process, thus ensuring that adequate separation between individual households exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. Before construction of emergency shelters, AVORD will closely coordinate with district officials and relevant line ministries at state and national levels to secure land tenure for a minimum of 3 years.  

Throughout project implementation, AVORD will seek integration with other programs by humanitarian partners in the area to ensure  value for money and maximize efficiency of the response.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increase the accessibility of lifesaving safe WASH services to the flood and drought-affected host communities and displaced IDPs in the Belet Weyne district of Hiran region, Hirshabelle State of Somalia.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to OCHA 2021 report, climate change continues to be a major contributing factor to displacement and food insecurity in Somalia. Increasing erratic weather patterns and climatic shocks have led to prolonged and severe drought conditions and floods, with devastating humanitarian consequences. Flooding displaced 919,000 people in 2020 and destroyed WASH infrastructures and productive assets. In tandem. Communities living in conflict areas were severely impacted by armed violence. The ongoing conflict continues to reduce the resilience of communities, trigger displacement and impede civilians&#x2019; access to basic services and humanitarians&#x2019; access to those in need. Exclusion and discrimination of socially marginalized groups are contributing to high levels of acute humanitarian need and lack of protection among some of the most vulnerable. IDPs remain the most vulnerable population group in Somalia. The protracted nature of displacement caused by floods, conflict, and drought continues to affect the physical and mental wellbeing of 1.6 million IDPs who require humanitarian assistance. Many IDP households have faced a steady depletion of assets and an increase in negative coping mechanisms, culminating in severe conditions with regards to their food insecurity, malnutrition, disease outbreaks, water and hygiene conditions, and critical protection concerns. According to the FSNAU report March 2021, large parts of Somalia faced severe drought conditions, triggered by below average 2020 Deyr rains and above-average temperatures during the Jilal season. Over 116,000 Somalis were displaced by water shortages between October 2020 and March 2021. Availability of water and pasture conditions have significantly deteriorated, leading to increased livestock migration and the rapid rise of water prices. According to the latest UNICEF humanitarian situation report, the water shortages and challenges of getting safe drinking water have contributed to cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) /cholera cases in some areas across the country. At the beginning of the rainy season in mid-April 2021, heavy rains in the Ethiopia highlands resulted in flood waves along the Shabelle River basin and streamed into Somalia leading to the displacement of the riverine population particularly in the northern parts of Beletweyne town, as well as damage of some community infrastructure and agriculture farms. In this project, AADSOM will implement safe WASH services to the flood and drought-affected communities and displaced IDPs in BeletWeyne district amp 5 villages (Gambarlaawe, Jeerey, Beled Salaama, Quracley, Dhariyow)  through carrying out the following:
1. At the inception, AADSOM will organize community mobilization meetings to the different sectors of the community, local authorities including women, people with disabilities, and minorities to give a good picture of the project deliverables. 
2. Rehabilitating/constructing strategic 30 flood-proof shallow wells with hand pumps with equal access of men, women, children including people with disabilities and marginalized communities.
3. Capacity building training of gender shared 30 WASH committees and 60 well operators (2/water source) from the rehabilitated water sources, each WASH committee composing 7 persons (3 women and 4 men), to ensure the sustainability of water sources after the project is faced out.
4. Construction of 124 gender-sensitive flood-proof latrines to reduce the open defecation practices (11 of the latrines will be accessible with people with disabilities).
5. AADSOM will train 10 Community Hygiene Promoters on better practices of hygiene and protection/prevention methodologies of Covid-19 to carry out hygiene/covid-19 awareness campaigns. 
6. The trained CHPs will carry out hygiene/covid-19 awareness campaigns to targeted to reach the targeted 15,000 men, women, and children.
7. AADSOM will distribute 2,000 HP kits to the most vulnerable households including the displaced IDPs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-saving basic WASH interventions to displaced, floods affected IDPs and vulnerable and marginalized host communities with inadequate humanitarian assistance in Jowhar District, Somalia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation in IDPs and vulnerable and marginalized host communities in undeserved and hard to reach areas within Jowhar district is alarming and require immediate attention. Significant gaps have been reported in flood affected areas regarding to food, emergency shelter, non-food items, and safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. According to joint assessments conducted by GSA, AV and HIWA in July 2021, the flooding situation in Jowhar district has resulted massive displacement affecting particularly children, mothers, elderly and disabled people who are now facing serious drinking water shortage, hunger, health and protection risks in an area already receiving little to no humanitarian assistance due to insecurity. AS operations remain high and security situation is in unpredictable. People are at a high risk of hunger and illness such as waterborne diseases which has already been reported in some of the assessed areas. Protection concerns are at alarming rate, there are increasing cases of GBV lack of privacy in IDP&#x2019;s camps. IDPs lose their property whenever they are evicted women and girls suffer most due to increased exposure to the risk of rape. Serious protection concerns have also been recorded such as sexual violence which was found as the highest ranked, followed by threats from AS, limited freedom of movement, family separations, recruitment of child solders by AS and killings as result of clan issues and conflict. The impact of the ongoing flooding in Jowhar district compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall may result in further deterioration of humanitarian situation. In terms of basic needs, WASH and food has been recognized as the priority need, followed by Shelter and NFIs, Security, Health, Nutrition and Protection. To address the needs stated above, the project aims to save the lives of these floods affected IDPs and vulnerable and marginalized host communities in undeserved and hard to reach areas within Jowhar district by providing immediate life-saving WASH assistance, to enhance resilience and improve the wellbeing of people especially for children, woman and vulnerable groups, such as persons with disabilities in cholera/AWD hotspots and crowded IDP settlements by emergency water supply through construction of 1 strategic boreholes, rehabilitation of 8 shallow wells with chlorination, pipeline extensions and distribution systems, construction of 200 flood proof latrines that consider people with disabilities in IDPs camps and host communities and dissemination of hygiene best practice through IECs with and distribution of hygiene kits and formation and training of WASH committees on the operation and maintenance of the WASH infrastructures. The project will target 19,612 IDPs and flood vulnerable and marginalized people who are living in Tawakal, Jiliyaale, Sheikh Omar, Biaso and Waqwaqley IDPs camps and Geeda Barkan, Gafey, Lamawab and Sabuun villages in Jowhar district. GSA WASH interventions will be implemented in coordination with complementary activities by other organizations targeting the same locations and beneficiaries, where they will cover CCCM, Shelter and protection components. This integrated approach will be useful to create synergies of services and expertise within the same location and same population leading to achieving a greater impact.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve living conditions of displaced people through site development, care and maintenance and decongestion initiatives targeting 20 IDPs in the urban and rural settlements  in Afgoye District</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project by IRDO is designed to improve living conditions of displaced people through site development, care and maintenance and decongestion initiatives. It will be implemented in 20 IDP camps identified and assessed by IRDO covering both the urban and rural settlements in Afgoye district, Lower Shabelle region. Anticipated to take 12 months, IRDO will carry out trainings on-site maintenance and site planning to camp committees support community led site maintenance activities to ensure upkeep of sites (cash for work, site maintenance committees, and distribution of tools) administer joint stakeholder site decongestion activities allowing for short-term improvements in settlement standards, minimizing protection threats and ameliorating COVID19 transmission. 

Undertake a monthly site monitoring and service mapping in all the 20 camps carry out CMC trainings on core cluster modules and lastly community mobilization and sensitization on the prevention of covid-19 spread and GBV awareness raising. The outcome envisioned will guarantee the safety of the 20 IDPs sites in both the rural and urban settlements and it will be measured by the number of people benefiting from improved site conditions of the target camps.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, Somalia had been hit by Multiple threats from Covid-19, locusts, conflict, insecurity, forced evictions, droughts, and flooding. The number of people in need has consistently increased over the last three years, from 4.2 million in 2019 to 5.2 million in 2020 and 5.9 million in 2021 according to the CCCM cluster Acaps review. This is further reflected in the number of displaced people in 2020/2021. 47% of the population of 12.3 million needs some form of humanitarian assistance, including 2.7 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), with an additional half a million displaced on average per year as a result of climatic conditions and conflict. Most displacement-affected persons face multiple or recurrent displacements, with a majority of IDPs having been displaced at least five times previously and very few return to areas of origin. Post-Gu IPC analysis conducted in September 2020 by FEWSNET and partners, indicates that an estimated 1.7 million people are anticipated to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with 0.4 million persons experiencing an emergency (IPC Phase 4). An additional 3.0 million persons are expected to be Stressed (IPC Phase 2), with the current conditions projected to remain unchanged by end of 2020. Projections running into 2021, through May, predict continued Stressed (IPC 2) and Crisis (IPC 3) outcomes to persevere, largely due to continued struggles of affected households to overcome shocks. Households in IDP areas in the Banadir region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by the high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large-scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. Camp coordination and camp management is a relatively a concept that&#x2019;s limited within the region and it is of utmost importance that key stakeholders i.e. government officials and humanitarian actors, be sensitized to this concept. 

SCC will implement these activities in 20 IDP sites in Kahda district of Banadir region with over 30,000HHs as per the latest detailed site assessment (DSA), targeting a largely underserved area. Approximately 36000 IDPs (6000 households) will benefit from this proposed intervention, in addition to the community working in these sites including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors, which might attract more IDPs, excessive flooding, or conflict with the landowners or the authorities, which may cause IDPs to flee to other areas. Gender will be mainstreamed into the project through the specific consideration of the different needs of women, men, boys, and girls during the design of activities. The project will ensure that all participants have equal access to resources and training. Monitoring and evaluation will be based on gender, age, and diversity dis-segregated data. SCC will implement this intervention in the Kahda district of Banadir region targeting 6000 HHs. Kaxda District is one of the IDP major hubs in Mogadishu that hosts the largest number of IDPs. Throughout the project, the needs of women, girls, men, and boys of all ages will be addressed throughout the planning, implementation and monitoring, and evaluation of the activities. Through regular site monitoring, needs and gaps will be reported and shared with partners and all stakeholders. Particular attention regarding needs will be paid to women and girls who also have to contend with GBV and protection concerns within camp settings. Through this project, SCC will also address the current and newly identified needs by setting up camp coordination structures at the national and, where necessary, regional or district levels, facilitating and supporting the establishment of effective coordination and management in IDP sites while respecting national context and authorities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve the living conditions of 36,000 displaced people in Banadir through improved site management and coordination, enhanced service delivery and site upkeep and
decongestion initiatives.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project seeks to enhance the living conditions and access to service for estimated 36,000 IDP persons from 40 settlements in Kahda and Daynile districts of Benadir. This will be achieved through a number of interrelated and complementary activities including enhancing the capacity of camp governance structures and site-level committees to promote information-sharing and foster system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include organizing site-level coordination meetings among service providers and local authorities to highlight priority needs and challenges, mitigate protection risks and ensure efficient use of existing referral pathways. 10 site-level mobilizers, each serving as a focal point for 4 sites, will be hired from target IDPs to circulate key messages, report on gaps, conduct service mapping, needs and new arrivals, conduct site monitoring and take shelter-level CFM complaints in close coordination with the CCCM cluster and other partners to effectively address vulnerabilities and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. 

Site maintenance committees and IDPs in target settlements will be equipped with a range of site maintenance tools and supplies before engaging in cash-for-work schemes through which community-led site upkeep and maintenance activities will be carried out. In the selection of cash-for-work beneficiaries, AVORD will adapt a systematic approach with a clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable households including the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. 

The effectiveness of the aid package will be evaluated through monitoring of activities thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. Protection will be mainstreamed throughout project duration by closely coordinating with other partners operating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) crisis centers and facilitating principled referrals where necessary. An elaborate feedback and complaint mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population. Target sites will be prioritized based on vulnerability such as congestion levels, proportion of minority groups, potential exposure to protection risks and overall living conditions. AVORD will utilize cluster tools such as the IDP site risk map or DSA data in the process of site selection. A site-level Complaint and Feedback Mechanism (CFM) will be developed and the project team will ensure that the system is accessible for all populations and that the mechanism is clearly understood and supported by the community.

The present proposal will complement an interagency program currently being implemented by AVORD and other partners in Banadir to provide WASH and awareness raising services to reduce Covid 19 transmission. Synergies will be developed with these activities to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the resources.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention aims to ensure children and youth affected by pre-drought conditions as well as COVID-19 pandemic have access to safe and protective learning environments in under-served and hard-to access areas in Luuq, Belethawa and Dolow districts of Gedo, and are also able to access immediate and sustained learning opportunities. Further, the intervention proposes to support learner retention, improve learning environment and ensure safety of learners. The intervention has been designed to meet the needs of vulnerable girls, women, boys and men, IDPs and host communities in the three target districts (Luuq, Belethawa and Dolow). In ensuring centrality of protection, the program has been designed to enhance awareness/dissemination of child protection amp safeguarding principles with targeted girls and boys through establishment of leadership networks/clubs/platforms in targeted public schools in Gedo region. The intervention has based a big bulk of its outputs towards supporting IDP children (70%) and children from vulnerable host communities to enroll in permanent functional schools within Gedo, to ensure sustainability. The intervention is designed to build on gains made by the ongoing Education Cannot Wait (ECW) project as well as DFID funded Leave No Girl Behind (LNGB) which targets the same schools and locations, and to leverage and complement on other sectoral interventions in the same schools (WASH, Protection, Health), and will adopt an integrated approach that will focus on drought, protection, COVID-19 prevention and control, and life-saving interventions. In order to ensure access to safe and protective learning environment for vulnerable learners, the intervention shall among other key interventions: construct/rehabilitate TLS, provide safe drinking water hygiene promotion in schools (including COVID-19 prevention and control messaging), distribute sanitary kits to girls, establish school WASH facilities based on need, distribute TLM, pay emergency teacher incentives, provision of school feeding program as well as implementation of child protection activities in line with the education and child protection integrated response framework. The intervention will be implemented in a total of eighteen (18) schools in Gedo Region. The final list of schools will be agreed upon together with the Gedo Education Cluster Focal Point (HIRDA) to ensure that only the most needy drought-affected schools are supported. A draft list of the schools (including locations) to be supported is provided in the documents section.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide Emergency response and restoration of livelihood assets related to food and income sources for population affected by multiple shocks in Gedo region Somalia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Critical humanitarian needs persist in Somalia across the different livelihood groups whose vulnerabilities continue to worsen due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, COVID-19 pandemic and escalating conflict. The poor Deyr rains (October to December 2020) led to the inadequate pasture for livestock, water shortage and below average crop production. The deteriorating food security outlook combined with the worsening malnutrition appeals for a rapid, well-targeted and coordinated scale up of responses to save lives and recovery of livelihoods assets. The project aims to improve immediate access to food while restoring livelihood assets related to food and income sources that have been impacted by water shortages through conditional cash transfers to enhance livelihood opportunities and rehabilitation of water infrastructures and provision of fodder seeds (Sudan grass) in agro-pastoral and pastoral villages in Belet-Hawa district, Gedo region. 
The project will target 815 vulnerable drought affected agro-pastoral and pastoral households among women, men, boys, girls, including female headed households who are classified under IPC 3 amp 4. The detrimental effects of the current shocks have severely and directly affected rural communities whose sources of food, income and water are diminishing and increasingly at risk leading to household food insecurity, increase in debt levels among poor households and a severe reduction in access to safe water for both domestic and livestock use. Additionally, the affected households rely on food purchase from local markets, have weak purchasing power due to limited income and lack access to credit services due to cumulative debts. 
COOPI prioritizes respect for the rights, dignity and safety of the people affected by crisis and is committed to taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the populations benefiting from the intervention. During implementation process, target communities, especially women, girls and the disabled will be included in community representative committees and decision making processes In selection of beneficiaries, registrations, verifications and monitoring exercises so as ensure that the most marginalized and vulnerable are represented and have influence. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. In order to improve household immediate access to food, conditional cash transfer will be provided to 815 affected household including girls, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men to enable them immediately access food, water, healthcare, and other basic services.
To restore livelihood assets of households, 815 beneficiaries will engage in cash for work activities construction and/or rehabilitation of water catchments and water harvesting structures (soil bunds), 150 households among the CFW beneficiaries will also be provided with fodder seeds (Sudan grass) in the areas where soil bunds structures have been constructed to regenerate pasture to ensure availability of fodder for livestock. This activity aims at restoring livestock assets of the communities and envisages reducing workload and stress on women and girls who are responsible for feeding livestock. In addition, gender based violence and exploitation malpractices associated with in search of livestock feeds and water for long distances will be mitigated through the proposed activity. In summary the following activities will be carried out:
1. Provide conditional cash transfer to 815 households in Belet-Hawa district to increase household purchasing power and rehabilitate livelihood assets and water sources.
2. Support to fodder production through provision of Sudan grass seeds) for 150 affected households in Belet-Hawa district.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support for Improved Immediate Access to Food for Vulnerable Households in Galkayo South, Mudug Region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The planned FSL project intervention is cluster specific response that conforms to the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2021 and the 1st 2021 SHF Standard Allocation for Food Security and Livelihoods that will respond to acute water shortages in Galkayo South (Mudug region), which are experiencing pre-drought conditions.

The Project will improve immediate access to food while restoring livelihoods related to food and income sources that have been impacted by water shortages occasioned by pre-drought conditions, conflicts and impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

The Project targets an estimated 706HH (4,236 people) assessed to be in acute food insecurity, &#x2018;Crisis&#x2019; and &#x2018;Emergency&#x2019; phases of IPC (3 and 4) by providing them with a means to sustained access to food and water support. The project will undertake Conditional Cash Transfer for 662 unskilled labourers and 44 semi-skilled labourers rehabilitating 9 Water Pans in 9 settlements in Galkayo South. Each of the 662 unskilled labourers shall get $6 per day while each of the 44 semi-skilled labourers will work at the rate of $8 per day:- Daily work output per person per day as per the Somalia CWG standards is 1.585M3 ( 5hours* 0.317M3). The total number of working days is 25 for each water pan, However, they will be rehabilitated in different months to allow for prudent supervision, monitoring and evaluation and reporting by the project team. The nine water pans to be rehabilitated are 1. Gaarcad, 2. Dhagfaruuryaale, 3. Cinjirre, 4. Laamawayne, 5. Rasan, 6. Balicadde, 7. Xaarxaar, 8. Qooraseyn, 9.Biyogaduud.

The project will specifically prioritise destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the four Districts). The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the poor October to December 2020 Deyr rains and Desert locust infestation leading to inadequate pasture, water resources and below-average crop production in Central Somalia Region. 

The project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and emerging gaps that will require a humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible below-average rainfall for the coming Gu 2021 season as indicated by FEWSNET/FSNAU in its February to September 2021 update. 

The project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries, ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them. The project will also ensure there is adequate protection of women in all the venues and staging points of the project activities to ensure it provides women the safety and protection required. Covid-19 preventive measures and health guidelines will also be mainstreamed in the project implementation. 

CPD plans to use the first 2 months of the project to undertake household vulnerability assessment in the identified locations within South Mudug, undertake community engagement, beneficiary selection, verification and registration for the Conditional Cash Transfers beneficiaries captured in KoboConnect. The beneficiary selection will be done through a Community-Based Target process (CBT) as recommended by the Somalia Cash Working Group (CWG). The rehabilitation works involving excavation of water pans to required provided dimensions will be done across 3 months for the 9 sites in Galkayo South of Mudug region. Payments to the unskilled and semi-skilled labourers will be made through Mobile Money Transfer once the scheduled work is completed. The project will carry out post-distribution monitoring in the final month of the project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of integrated lifesaving health and nutrition services to cisis affected population in Buuhoodle district of Togdheer region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation is deteriorating due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflict About 5.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, an increase from the 5.2 million reported in 2020. Up to 2.7 million people are expected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse and will face acute food insecurity through mid-2021. An estimated 840,000 children under the age of five are acutely malnourished, 143,000 of them severely and at risk of death. Food security is expected to worsen. The project is in line with Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF) Standard Allocation and will provide integrated life-saving emergency primary health care and nutrition needs of flood-affected women, men, boys and girls of proposed project targets in Buuhoodle district. NODO is proposing 12-month integrated Health and Nutrition project targeting the most affected populations in Buuhoodle district reaching a total of 15,250 persons including 11,200 women, 1,500 Men, 1,350 girls and  1200 boys)

Health: The proposed project will support 3 static and 1 mobile IERT centres in Buuhoodle district. NODO plans to deliver an integrated package of promotive, preventive and curative maternal, newborn amp child health services and scale-up outbreak early warning and response and case management of epidemic prone diseases through IERT response team as part of the efforts to support the flood affected communities in Buuhoodle. The project aims to maintain the static and mobile clinics in Buuhoodle IDP and host community&#x2019;s sites and scale up the health care through skilled health professionals. NODO through this project will provide regular medical supplies and life-saving drugs to established health facilities, establish referral mechanisms and improve the coverage of measles vaccinations, support safe motherhood and reproductive health while also ensuring readiness to prevent and respond to outbreaks such as malaria, measles or AWD/Cholera and promote health update through health education and beneficiary sensitization

Nutrition: The proposed nutrition activities will be integrated with the health interventions with the aim of addressing underlying causes of high levels malnutrition as well as to enable early identification of SAM cases for treatment  1 mobile and 3 fixed in targeted IDPs and host community in the most affected areas in Buuhoodle district. This program will establish a strong community network through competent community nutrition volunteers for early detection/case finding and referral of children and pregnant and lactating mothers with acute malnutrition. In addition to the treatment of acute malnutrition, the project will be promoting positive infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practice by providing IYCF promotion and counselling. NODO is strong partner for the nutrition cluster and therefore, will have close coordination with other partners in the district for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses. Through this project, a total 15,250 most affected individuals in Buuhoodle will have access to a package of Emergency lifesaving integrated health and nutrition services for twelve months&#x2019; period. The mobile team will provide comprehensive community screening, identification, treatment and referral services from community, IDP areas to the fixed OTP and SC to improve access to the integrated package for the vulnerable community prioritizing rapid referral of the most critical cases (priority will be given to under 5 children and pregnant and lactating women), it shall also capacity building of nutrition staff on IMAM, infant young child feeding best practices, IYCF. Referral of malnourished children with complicated cases will be done to the OTP integrated with PHC services managed by NODO and other actors in the program areas thus providing more holistic opportunity to the target beneficiaries.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increased Access to Community- and Facility-Based Nutrition Services to strengthen the Resilience of Children and Families in Karan and Yaqshid districts, Banadir Region, Somalia.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mercy-USA&#x2019;s strategic interventions will ensure increased access to nutrition services and expanded coverage through 4 fixed facilities, 5 outreach sites (1 mobile team), and community levels. This three-pronged approach is part of Mercy-USA&#x2019;s strategy to respond to populations&apos; immediate and medium-term needs under distress by supporting the local health facilities and the Ministry of Health capacity to implement nutrition interventions in line with nutrition guidelines available. Specifically, this nutrition program will promote access to quality care, adequate nutrition, and encourage healthier behaviors to optimize the communities&#x2019; resilience to future nutrition emergencies. 
Mercy-USA for Aid and Development, in partnership with the MoH, will continue to address the nutrition challenges by implementing the integrated package in 2 fixed facilities in Karan district and 2 fixed facilities and 5 outreach sites (1 mobile team) in Yaqshid district in Banadir region.
Facility and community-based Basic Nutrition Services Package (BNSP) will cover both curative and preventative interventions targeting children under 5 years old (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women.
Mercy-USA will ensure that the nutrition sites will receive uninterrupted therapeutic/supplementary food supplies. Mercy-USA will provide staff, technical capacity building for staff, and additional monitoring to ensure compliance with nutrition protocols. 
Mercy-USA will train all nutrition staff on SAM and MAM diagnosis and management. Mercy-USA will provide regular joint supervision of the health facilities with MoH and offer refresher trainings to staff.
This program will promote optimal nutrition and IYCF practices that are beneficial to child survival and development by focusing on the promotion, support, and protection of EBF for children and appropriate complementary feeding to build resilience and the nutrition status of infants lt6 months (through EBF) and children 6-24 months. Mothers with children lt6 months will receive messages specific to Exclusive Breastfeeding while mothers with children 6-24 months will receive messages on breastfeeding and complementary feeding. 
Screening for malnutrition among children lt5 and PLW will be conducted primarily at the community level though this screening will also occur at the health facilities by nutrition staff. Malnourished women and children will be admitted in the relevant OTP or TSFP programs. 
According to IMAM guidelines, children in the nutrition program will receive relevant micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A. Women in prenatal care will receive treatment for anemia if required as well as micronutrient supplementation, and postnatal women will be supplemented with Vitamin A and treatment of anemia if required. Additionally, all children admitted in the nutrition program will receive deworming drugs and relevant89` micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A.
Serious vaccine-preventable diseases are still prevalent in Somalia. Mercy-USA will thus support the provision of routine EPI activities. This will continue to increase immunization coverage among women and children lt5 years. IDPs, nomadic groups and remote or difficult to access communities are most at risk of missing out on routine EPI. Therefore, Mercy-USA will facilitate outreach nutrition and EPI teams to serve the people who are far from the facilities.
Additionally, Mercy-USA will screen everyone entering a healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and ensure all the preventive and control measures. Although screening for symptoms will not identify asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals with COVID 19 infection, symptom screening remains an important strategy to identify those who could have COVID-19 so appropriate precautions can be implemented.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improved access to prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition of children under 5 and PLW from IDPs, and vulnerable host communities in Heliwa and Kahda districts in  Banadir Region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed emergency nutrition interventions will provide integrated lifesaving treatment for acute malnutrition in the targeted districts of Heliwa and Kaxda through facility and community- based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) targeting children under five and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). The proposed project aims to increase coverage and access to the management of both moderate and severe acute malnutrition (MAM/SAM), vitamin A supplementation and deworming as well as promotion of optimal infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices. SOS will adopt an expansive IYCF in Emergencies (IYCF-E) strategy aimed at increasing reach beyond mothers raising infants but also fathers, grandfathers, community leaders, religious leaders, teachers, etc.

The proposed project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative nutrition services through the support of static health and nutrition facilities in Heliwa and Kaxda districts in Banadir region. The project activities will be implemented within SOS hospital in Heliwa and Community health center in Kahda The SOS nutrition teams will provide a systematic identi&#xFB01;cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to OTS, TSFP and Stabilization centers. The provision of OTP services for those children with SAM and the referral and treatment of SAM cases with medical complications to the SOS stabilization centre in Heliwa and other SCs in the nearest location in Kahda district. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of IYCF practices, promoting the adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be done, providing treatment for all age groups, both male and female prioritizing the disabled children to benefit from the nutrition services. The nutrition interventions will improve early identification and prevention of malnutrition and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality in the target districts. 

  Furthermore, the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and UNICEF IEC risk communication and print it in local language- Somali as well general awareness child protection prevention messages. The project will also ensure frontline health workers are well equipped and protected by distributing Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs) including facemasks, handwashing facilities, hand sanitizers, soaps, gloves, etc.

Finally, SOS will carry out the proposed activities in an integrated manner with other sectors such as Health, Food Security, WASH and Child Protection to promote synergy, and to address the underlying and root causes of acute malnutrition. Effects will be made to prevent occurrence of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) by collaborating with available mechanisms in the target locations. Gender mainstreaming will be fully ensured in the community mobilization events, service provision and for the training of staff and other project stakeholders. Data for the beneficiaries will be disaggregated by age and sex. SOS will promote full participation of women, girls and boys, in the project planning, monitoring and implementation to promote their voices are heard and are taken into account including communication preferences. A particular focus will be given to ensure participation of people with special needs or with disabilities by targeting 10% of the total target population in both districts.

At the end of the project, SOS will provide the following interventions
	Screening of 10903 children (4361 boys, 6542 girls) and 826 PLW for acute malnutrition 
	Treatment of 7268 children MAM and SAM 
	Treatment of 1000 SAM with complication 
	IYCF counselling and promotion messages
	MNS 
	Capacity building of staff, MOH/BRA and CNWs</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of integrated management and prevention of Acute Malnutrition to reduce morbidity and mortality in children less than five years as well as PLW in priority gap areas in Lasanod District of Sool region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite marginal improvements from &#x2018;critical&#x2019; levels in the overall nutrition situation in Somalia, malnutrition rates among children remained precarious at &#x2018;serious levels. Of concern were populations with critical prevalence of acute malnutrition above the threshold of 15 per cent, mainly in Northern Inland Pastoral Livelihood Zone (Lasanod District), as well as internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to food insecurity, high morbidity, low immunization and Vitamin-A supplementation, and poor care practices. ANPPCANSOM emergency response plan will scale up treatment of malnutrition and reach an estimated caseload of 1,407 SAM representing 50% of the nutrition cluster SAM burden of 2,806 in Lasanod District. 
The project will provide facility-based and community based (BNSP) covering both curative and preventative interventions targeting children U5 years (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women. It will support the identification, referral and treatment of children suffering from moderate and severe acute malnutrition while SAM cases with medical complications will be referred to the Lasanod Stabilization Center run by MSF using standard referral forms. ANPPCANSOM will support and manage 3 health centers (Tuulo Samakaab, Halhaliye, Dan )and 2 mobile teams  covering 20 remote sites (Biriqodey, Bixin, Burowadal, Buulal, Fardhidin, Gacandar, Garac Lagu Dhal, God Qaboobe, Higlo Fiqi, Faleeryale  Canjiid, Laas Magugle, Jidbaale, Kalax, Sango Jabiye, Karin Dabayl, Saha Gebogebo, Buq-Xaar, Adhicadeeye, Akuule) within Lasanod district. 
In order to ensure the sustainability of nutrition interventions, local technical capacity will be strengthened by integrating SAM management into the Primary Health Care system through the functional MCHs. Additionally, the capacity of nutrition staff will be strengthened for effective service delivery at facility and community level. 
ANPPCANSOM will maintain treatment outcomes consistent with Sphere standards using the combined protocol for the management of acute malnutrition in close consultation and coordination with Somalia Nutrition Cluster, Somaliland Nutrition Working Group and other nutrition partners including MOHD, UNICEF and WFP. ANPPCANSOM will build on and sustain the delivery of a holistic basic nutrition services package (BNSP) in priority to the target communities including internally displaced people and their host communities and other socially marginalized groups in pastoral and hard to reach in Lasanod district areas while ensuring the inclusion of treatment, promotion and prevention components in this project. 
The project will support community mobilization and screening as well as micro-nutrient supplementation for PLW (multiple micro-nutrients and Iron folate) and Vitamin A supplementation for children between 6-59 months. It will also provide de-worming for children 12-59 months and pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester as well as counselling and promotion on infant and young child feeding compounded with health and hygiene promotion. Moreover, measles immunization will be provided to infants living within the catchment areas of the target health centers who are not immunized against measles. Systematic defaulter tracing for immunization services will also be conducted at community level. 

In order to strengthen the accountability with affected population, we will introduce mother-led MUAC approach to increase detection, identification and early referral of malnourished children. ANPPCANSOM will train mothers to use MUAC tapes to enable mothers screen, detect oedema and self-referral of their children to nutrition sites.
Likewise, the project will give particular emphasis on the current COVID-19 pandemic prevention measure to contain the spread of the virus. Gender and protection activities will be effectively mainstreamed into the project. Every effort will be made to ensure equity and to reach the most vulnerable population in Lasanod District.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated lifesaving Nutrition project aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality related to acute malnutrition among the most vulnerable in Dhobley, Afmadow district,Lower Juba.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FSNAU 2020 post Deyr assessment indicates both GAM and SAM are serious with aggravating factors.  Food security is expected to worsen. The poor October to December 2020 Deyr rains led to the inadequate pasture, water resources and below average crop production. Weather predictions point towards a second consecutive season of below-average rainfall from April to June due to the La Nina effect. 
The key issues for children and women remain access to prevention and treatment interventions in the absence of a fully functional and stable health system. Tied to that is scarce availability of health professionals and poor community literacy levels (UNICEF 2019 OCHA 2020). Malnutrition is one of the key issues affecting children 6-59 moths and significantly contributing to mortality, considering relationship between malnutrition and disease. 
Services in Dhobley barely reach rural areas because of poor infrastructure . Therefore poor performing indicators like: Poor IYCF, low latrine coverage,low immunization coverage, severe food shortages and poor coverage of nutrition service/health facility are reported (WHO,2020SARA ,2016 FSNAU,2021).  Water shortage has already been reported in Dhobley with population displaced due to water shortage. This is expected to get worse if the predicted La Nina manifests next month (OCHA, 2021)
Women and children urgently need integrated services targeting prevention and treatment of both moderate and severe acute malnutrition.  WRRS is currently implementing a nutrition project by WFP that focuses on treatment of moderate acute malnutrition ( MAM) and maternal, child health and nutriton (MCHN) at health facilities . These services have not integrated treatment of  severe acute malnutrition (SAM) therefore children with SAM  are left untreated and so at risk of death. WFP funded project also lacks key primary prevention interventions like Micro nutrient supplementation for children 6-59 months and PLW, de worming and IYCF support. Integrating these services will  contribute to significant reduction in prevalence of malnutrition and related mortality.
The project will apply the grant strategy and help achieve cluster objective 2 of providing life saving interventions especially for those affected by drought like conditions. It focuses on scaling up and fully integrating nutrition interventions that will ensure full treatment of acute malnutrition.The proposed project will link to SHF&apos;s 2021 allocation strategy, the fund&apos;s strategic objectives and cluster specific objectives. We hope this will bring down the effects of the prevailing triple threat of COVID 19, floods and Desert Locusts , in addition to the most recent predicted La Nina, on acute malnutrition state. 
WRRS is currently implementing a nutrition project funded by WFP that covers treatment of Moderate acute malnutrition, MCHN and a relief project. The proposed project will bring in treatment of both complicated and uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition thus ensuring full treatment of acute malnutrition at one stop. Beneficiaries will not be referred to other facilities and/or partners, which sometimes complicates treatment by increasing defaulters. This project will also support primary prevention interventions not covered by WFP project, which are very vital. These will include Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) support and micro nutrient supplication for both children under five and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). This proposed project seeks to scale up and integrate treatment of acute malnutrition through a fixed site in Dhobley,being in a health facility. which will of will offer TSFP for treatment of MAM,OTP for treatment of  uncomplicated SAM and Stabilization center for treatment of complicated SAM, all these with prevention interventions. There will also be 1 mobile team to cover IDP  and hard to reach rural areas with treatment of MAM and uncomplicated SAM integrating  prevention interventions.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to FSNAU Post Deyr 2020/ technical assessment, the overall health, food security and nutrition needs remain significant within most parts of Somalia with an estimated. In Ceelwaq nutrition situation of district continues to deteriorate further with limited humanitarian assistance. Post day 2020 released by FSNAU in Februar 2021 indicated that a chronic high level of acute malnutrition in Elwak district. The target areas have many challenges contributing to acute malnutrition particularly rural areas where access is constrained. The Desert Locust has caused significant damage to 2020 pastures and grassing land for livestock&#x2019;s which the backbone liveliho of communities in Ceelwaq. The latest forecasts indicate that Desert Locust continues to pose a very high risk to rural livelihoods across Somalia in 2021, potentially exacerbating the impact of the anticipated below-average 2021 Gu rains. The Nutrition Cluster estimates caseloads of about 300 SAM and 2120 MAM annually in the Ceelwaq district with an estimated population of about 30,689 population PESS. HDC is an active nutrition/health partner and currently implementing EAC simplified protocol in partnership with UNICEF as well HIV-Global fund emergency health in Ceelwaq general hospital, Dhamasa and Hosqurun MCHs in Ceelwaq district. In Decembe 2020, UNICEF emergency projects, Covid 19, emergency primary health and implementation of the expanded admission criteria of acute malnutrition to the outpatient therapeutic program EAC that supported health and nutrition intervention in Ceelwaq district implemented by HDC came to a end. This left a gap in health and nutrition in three-way district. The Proposed project will therefore bridge the major essential nutrition service gap that currently exists in Ceelwaq following the ended UNICEF and HDC PD out of the integrated health and nutrition Project. The project will address the identified gaps in nutrition, enhancing access to nutrition services within their localities aimed at improving the physical and mental well-being of boys, girls, men and women in the targeted locations. These specific needs have been outlined in the HRP and FSNAU and UNOCHA mulita cluster need rapid assessment gaps identified in the targeted locations. The proposed project is geared towards reducing the vulnerability of the beneficiaries and communities. HDC will work with MOH-Federal, JSS-MOH to address the nutrition gaps identified. The services will be both preventive and curative targeting vulnerable men, women, boys, girls, and persons living with physical disabilities in the targeted district. 2 Mobile and outreach implementation models will be adopted to address the needs of vulnerable beneficiaries in remote and geographically isolated and hard to reach populations in Ceelwaq district. Screening for malnutrition will be carried out and children with MAM will be treated in OTP sites. Children with MAM will be referred to HDC Managed district hospital supported by UNICEF before but still functional supporting by HDC. Children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with medical complication will be referred to the SCs that HDC propose to support in Ceelwaq district hospital and Damase referral health center in Ceelwaq district. However, we are facing a shortage of funding to sustain the existing nutrition services. Through this project, HDC is planning to maintain and support the existing nutrition services (2 fixed OTP, 1 stabilization center in the Ceelwaq general hospital with integration of health projects and one mobile teams into reaching 6 villages comprising IDPs and Hard to reach rural population mostly affected by crises in Elwak district. This nutrition intervention will build on HDC&apos;s ongoing emergency nutrition and health interventions in high risks areas in Ceelwaq district and will support the continuation of essential life-saving treatment in the context of COVID and other ongoing outbreaks in line with IMAM guideline.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improved, well-coordinated gender sensitive and quality child protection services for Boys and girls including adolescents, children with disabilities facing life-threatening risks of abuse, neglect, violence, exploitation, and severe distress in Luuq.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the beginning of 2020, additional shocks, extensive floods, desert locust infestations, the COVID-19 pandemic and drought have had compounding effects, further deteriorating already compromised systems and gains that had already been made in the economy. The secondary impacts have impacted directly the well-being of children with the rise of negative coping mechanisms being witnessed and reported such as rise in child marriage, psychological distress, sexual violence and other harmful practices. According to the Humanitarian Needs Overview (2021) children and adolescents in Somalia are targets of killing, maiming and abduction, recruitment into armed groups, detention, sexual and physical violence. Boys are at an elevated risk of recruitment to armed groups. The actual extent of grave violations of children&#x2019;s rights is higher than what is reported and verified. Separated and unaccompanied children are at heightened risk of various forms of violence, exploitation and abuse. While some have been placed into alternative care arrangements, a large number live alone or in the street. COVID-19 and the drought situation has stretched the foster families providing alternative care to the children. The Child Protection AoR assessment in 2020 carried out among partners also reported that children were expressing aggressive behaviors which point out to psychological distress stemming from the dire living conditions at home. IA recent study conducted by WVI in Luuq and other neighboring districts revealed that the market places, water points were some of the places identified by both IDPs and host communities as unsafe for children. The major child protection concerns identified during this study included child labour, child marriage, school dropout and sexual violence. These results are   corroborated by the education cluster reports that indicated that children are out of school in Gedo region as a result of drought with about 6000 primary school children affected. This project has been designed to respond to these needs through risk mitigation and prevention of violations of children rights and addressing child protection needs through case management. Leveraging on already existing health, WASH and Food and Cash Assistance projects in Luuq, this project&#x2019;s interventions have been designed to synergize efforts to deliver well-coordinated interventions to address the child protection needs. This presence of WVI staff in Luuq and the existing connection with community structures already provides registered vulnerable people groups for this project to build on. Prevention of violations and risk mitigation through a community led process has been factored including capacity building plans for self-protection among the children and their care givers. Awareness raising on the child protection and equipping of care givers with positive parenting skills is provided for to ensure children associated with armed forces and armed groups are safely re-integrated within their households and community.  To increase access to specialized child protection services either directly or through referral, update and dissemination of the referral pathway is one of the key intervention planned for to raise awareness among service providers and the community for quick and timely response. Provision for MHPSS at individual and group level has been created to meet the needs of children across different ages. Home visits will be facilitated by the care givers to meet the needs of children with disability to ensure they are not left out. Child Friendly Spaces as a measure for MHPSS has also been included in the project. COVID-19 control measures of hand washing and provision of masks for the children will be done. Screening before admission will also be done with the CFS being equipped with thermometers. Through these activities, 1300boys, 1650girls, 850men, 1100 women and 354 of persons with disability 50M,60W,122B and122G will be reached.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Support in WASH, Protection, Shelter/NFI and CCCM by DRC, HAPEN, NoFYL and SEDHURO in Belet Xaawo District, Gedo Region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at strengthening safe access to multi sectorial services for IDPs and other vulnerable groups in BeletXaawo through integrated Protection, Shelter, CCCM and WASH interventions. Interventions will be implemented jointly by the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) and Horn of Africa Peace Network (HAPEN), NoFYL and SEDHURO. DRC will implement both general protection and WASH components. While HAPEN will implement Shelter/NFI components, NoFYL will implement CCCM and HLP components while SEDHURO will carry out the Child Protection component. DRC and HAPEN had originally entered into a teaming agreement for the implementation of project but with the approval of NoFYL and SEDHURO as implementation partners, active collaboration and coordination with the two organizations will be explored. The integrated approach by the 4 organizations, will create synergies, utilize agency expertise and community networks to access and provide adequate and quality services to the most vulnerable members of the community. 


The proposed DRC intervention is designed to contribute to the 2021 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and the efforts to address the needs of most vulnerable displacement affected communities with a focus on Belet Xaawo district, Gedo region which is a key location targeted by SHF allocation strategy in 2021. The intervention will promote Protection as a central part of programming and will incorporate continuous awareness creation, analysis of protection risks, training amp follow up for effective implementation in line with the Centrality of Protection Strategy 2020-2021 adopted by the HCT in June 2020. Specifically, the project will strengthen the protection of most vulnerable girls, boys, women and men affected by climatic shocks, conflict and COVID-19 by reducing risks and vulnerabilities and increasing community capacities. It will also address needs exacerbated by the ongoing pre-drought conditions as a result of poor rainfall, impact of floods in 2020 and the ongoing locust infestation. The project will employ participatory and community-based and right based approaches as well as age, gender, diversity and inclusion to ensure vulnerable communities receive adequate and quality responses. Key interventions will include protection monitoring and assessments, strengthening of existing referral pathways. Community based mechanisms will be strengthened to prevent and respond to protection concerns. 


WASH activities will focus on both immediate and sustainable intervention that include improved access to safe water. DRC will carry out rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures, construction of new water infrastructures, water trucking, establishment of gender balanced water management committees, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women leadership and participation in WASH projects, installation of new sanitation facilities (culture sensitive and addressing specific needs of different sex and disabled groups) in settlements hosting newly displaced population and hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and hygiene kits distribution, including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes, etc.)
The project will target to reach 30,000 individuals&#x2019; people (7000 men, 8000, women, 7000 boys, 8000 girls).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Emergency Shelter and NFIs in Belet Xaawo District, Gedo Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will provide  life-saving shelter and NFI kits to IDPs who have not accessed similar support for the last two years in Ajuaran, Jaron, Odaa, Gawido, Malkarie, Idan and Bula Amin camps in Belet Hawa district. The camps have been selected on the basis of need, high proportion of the newly arrived, lack of similar support and accessibility. The needs of the beneficiaries have been identified through a joint rapid needs assessment conducted by HAPEN and DRC in March 2021.

The target population (women, girls, men, boys, elderly and people with disabilities) are living in small makeshift structures made of sub-standard materials that compromise their privacy, physical security and protection from weather extremes. The families lack adequate access to NFIs, having lost them during displacement.

HAPEN will distribute Emergency Shelter Kits (ESKs) and non-food items (NFI) kits to 2333 households, including 230 host households who are equally vulnerable in the interest of Do-No Harm principle and in support of reintegration. An owner-driven approach in the construction of shelters where beneficiaries are assisted and capacitated to undertake the construction. The process will enable them to undertake basic repairs using local materials or rebuild their shelters in future, thus contributing to sustainability of the benefits beyond the project period. On monitoring, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution of NFIs and ESKs respectively. The exercises will provide beneficiary feedback on project effectiveness and will target 90% of the beneficiaries to ensure proper representation and accuracy.

To ensure accountability, HAPEN will establish community response and feedback mechanisms (CRFM) in the targeted sites. This will be comprised of a CRFM desk and a hotline to offer a channel for beneficiaries to register concerns. 

HAPEN will work closely with local administration to plan distribution points, schedules and instill order during the exercises to minimize protection risks. The timing and locations of all distributions will put the safety of women, girls, boys, elderly, disabled and those with limited mobility into consideration. Distribution exercises will be done within reasonable daylight hours. Distances to distribution sites and facilities provided by the project will be minimal and safe. It will be made clear that support provided by the project will be at no cost to the beneficiaries, hence no favours should be solicited from beneficiaries. COVID-19 prevention measures will be observed at all points where project requires beneficiaries, leaders or partners to gather. In general, the project will address protection risks and inclusion of women, disabled and minorities at all stages.

Community structures including project community committees will play key roles in decision making, implementation and monitoring of activities and will be comprised of men, women and representatives of the disabled and the minority. 

In particular, this project will closely coordinate and harmonize with Protection, WASH, CCCM and Housing, Land amp Property (HLP)  interventions to be implemented by other partners (DRC, SEDHURO and  NOFYL)  in the same district or camps and in general all other initiatives in the district to ensure complementarity. Under the coordination arrangements, organizations implementing different projects will plan together and share information during the selection of beneficiaries to avoid duplication.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-saving shelter assistance to 6,720 newly arrived and protracted IDPs in Banadir through distribution of Non-Food Items and provision of emergency shelter kits.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the context of protracted humanitarian crisis in Somalia where 3 million people are in need of shelter assistance, AVORD is submitting this proposal  to contribute to improved living conditions in Banadir. The target group will be carefully selected from protracted and newly arrived IDPs in overcrowded settlements at-risk of Covid 19 outbreak. Special priority will be accorded to households in deplorable shelter conditions, the evicted, those who have lost household items and shelter due to disasters, persons with disabilities, female headed households and people from marginalized groups. 

Under the proposed initiative, 1,120 kit-based Non-Food Items (NFIs) will be distributed to 1,120 households (6,720 persons) in Banadir. In-line with shelter cluster standards, each NFI kits will contain core items such as 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 double Mosquito Net, 1 Solar lamp and 2 Jerrycan with the capacity of 10 liters each. Disbursement of relief items will be need-based, and will be decided in close coordination with the Shelter Cluster to ensure that available stocks are used to respond to crisis and that activities contribute to the attainment of cluster strategic objectives. In addition to NFIs, 1,120 registered households (6,720 will also receive emergency shelters. To ensure complementarity, the same group who received the NFIs will receive the emergency shelters. Site planning will be an integral part of the shelter development process, thus ensuring that adequate separation between individual households exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. Before construction of emergency shelters, AVORD will closely coordinate with district officials and relevant line ministries at state and national levels to secure land tenure for a minimum of 3 years.   

Full beneficiary details including name, settlement and contact information will be captured to facilitate monitoring activities and ensure that aid is given to those in need. A Post Distribution Monitoring Exercise (PDM) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and document lessons learnt. 

In the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek integration with own interventions in Banadir where AVORD is implementing other programs, and with other humanitarian partners to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide life-saving and sustainable integrated Health and WASH interventions for vulnerable settlements and communities in Kismayo, Lower Juba</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Save the Children (SC) proposes to deliver an integrated package of Health and WASH lifesaving support interventions to most vulnerable settlements and communities (including men, women, boys and girls) in Lower Juba, Kismayo district in a dignified manner. These interventions are based on the 2021 allocation strategy paper, 2021 Jubaland Drought Risk Assessment findings, and the proposed activities are well aligned with the Health and WASH cluster priorities.
The project aims to improve access for health services to mitigate, control and manage outbreaks (waterborne diseases) and filling critical gaps, while also addressing safe water and sanitation provision through emergency/ lifesaving WASH interventions and enhancing better hygiene practices in Kismayo district. This project will reach 22,000  beneficiaries (men: 5,060, women: 5,500, boys:5,500 , girls: 5,940) over nine (9) months.
The health component will seek to support two (2) mobile health teams to ensure provision of emergency and essential primary health care services with emphasis on waterborne disease mitigation, control and management. SC will support the mobile health teams to provide emergency reproductive health services for underserved with referral pathways established for Gender Based violence (GBV) and Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) linkages. Provision of essential medication and supplies (including Personal Protective equipment (PPEs) and COVID-19 related supplies) will be ensured for the mobile teams with well-integrated patient safety protocols as well as accessibility and accountability mechanisms. SC will also support provision of essential routine immunization services. To ensure preventative measures for diseases and outbreaks, SC will actively support community engagement and health education (with integrated hygiene messages) to community members of different sex, age and disability groups in a dignified manner.
For the WASH component, SC plans to conduct water trucking through vouchers to 8,889 drought affected settlements, rehabilitate 5 shallow wells, and 1 extension of existing water infrastructure. The project will also increase access to communal latrines and hand-washing with soap through construction of 56 culture sensitive latrines while addressing specific needs of different sex and disability groups to ensure safety and easy access to facilities. Additionally, beneficiaries of the water and sanitation and health services will be sensitized on hygiene promotion measures with a focus on proper hand washing with soap, safe waste and excreta disposal and household (HH) water treatment and safe storage, distribute 3666 hygiene kits including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes, etc.) to vulnerable households and build community resilience and increase sustainability of WASH services by enhancing the capacity of village level WASH management committees to manage, operate and maintain WASH facilities.
The project is designed to ensure equitable access to WASH services by older people and those with disabilities, safety of children and dignity and privacy for women and girls. Coordination with health and WASH clusters at national and state levels will be maintained, in addition to ongoing coordination with general key actors in Lower Juba. The project will address gender issues through collecting sex and age disaggregated data which will be analyzed to identify gaps, provide gender sensitive interventions and ensure participation and empowerment of women. Protection of beneficiaries will be ensured during access and utilization of services seeking to reduce further risks.
SC aims to increase access to clean and safe drinking water, sanitation and improve hygiene knowledge and promote the adoption of safe hygiene practices among the communities, contributing to a reduced risk of disease outbreak and acute needs.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation in Somalia is deteriorating due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflict About 5.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, an increase from the 5.2 million reported in 2020. Up to 2.7 million people are expected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse and will face acute food insecurity through mid-2021. An estimated 840,000 children under the age of five are acutely malnourished, 143,000 of them severely and at risk of death. According to Somalia HNO for 2021 the protracted crisis in Somalia, compounded by COVID-19, floods and droughts, has resulted in massive challenges in meeting the WASH needs of the Somali population. According to the JMCNA, approximately 8.9 million people are affected by poor WASH conditions. For 2021, it is estimated that 4.6 million people are in catastrophic (10 per cent), severe (9 per cent) or extreme (18 per cent) need of humanitarian WASH assistance. The 10 per cent of households in catastrophic need mainly face a lack of access to water both in terms of quality and quantity, accompanied by a lack of access to functional sanitation. It is also a cause of relapse for acute diarrheal diseases when treated patients and children return to their communities with limited safe water and sanitation coverage, resulting in limited sustainability of health programs.
According to assessment conducted by BTSC in Nov,2020 findings revealed that majority of the households (63.3%) use unsafe water from a water catchment or a dam as their primary source for drinking water and the said dam has dried up and the cost of 200 litters of water is currently costing between $3-$4 US Dollars which is not affordable to the drought affected communities. Additionally, 43.5% of sampled households do not treat drinking water. The assessment also revealed that only 45% of the resident do have access to latrines and 98% of those latrines are not accessible to people with disabilities. only 37.5% of the assessed families reported to have access to soap.
In the context mentioned above GRRN will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming (1)Improve access to safe water through water trucking to 10,000 drought affected population in priority sites /settlements/ communities targeting in Bay(Burhakaba). Rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures one borehole and 6 shallow wells with hand pump. (2) Construction of water infrastructures including construction of tanks and distribution networks, hybrid solar water pumping system in Burhakaba Borehole (Site selection should aim at reducing the risk of violence against women and children accessing water sources through their participation in discussions). (3)Establishment of gender balanced water management committees for ensuring continuity` of services, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women leadership and participation in WASH projects.(4) construction of 60 latrines in settlements (culture sensitive and addressing specific needs of different sex and disabled groups) hosting new displaced population. (5) Hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and 1,500 hygiene kits distribution, including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes) accompanied by robust hygiene promotion activities. GRRN WASH technical designs adhere to SPHERE standards/Somalia WASH cluster guidelines, mainstreaming protection and disability, gender considerations per IASC guidelines for GBV Interventions in Humanitarian settings, WASH Chapter as well as the environmental protection considerations and securing access to the elderly and those with special needs as per Handicap International Guidelines. The total beneficiaries targeted in this project are 14,000(6,720 women, 4,480 men, 1,680 girls and 1,120 boys) in Burhakaba.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The impact of the ongoing drought compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 escalated conflict and forecast of below-average Deyr rainfall from April to June 2021 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood followed by drought in the Jalalaqsi district to 15,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved and/or hard to reach communities from 5 villages under Jalalaqsi namely Doondheere, Raafey, Habar robe, Cadiley, Sheeloow, Dirggoys east, Buulo Barwaaqo, Baqdaad east and Jalalaqsi town. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project are the following WASH services:
Water:
- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) for a period of 45 days. (Site of the distribution selection by the women/girls should aim at reducing the risk of violence against women and children accessing water sources through their participation in discussions).

- Construction of 5 flood-proof shallow wells with hand pumps in 5 villages in Jalalaqsi district, (Baqdad east, Dirgoys east, Raafey, Dondheere, and Bulo Barwaaqo) with special consideration on disabled and child-friendly accessibility.
- Upgrade one borehole in Jalalaqsi town (Amaana Borehole) Howlwadaag section of Jalalaqsi town, equipped with the hybrid system including rehabilitation of existing water tank, construction of water kiosk for human use, Construction of engine room, and piping network.
- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 6 WASH committees and 12 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting.

Hygiene and Sanitation:
Lack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people&#x2019;s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. nevertheless, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: 

- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion compounded with covid-19 awareness campaigns to reach 15,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health, and feeding centers. 
-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out. 
-Distribute 500 HP kits to 500 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and
- Construct 58 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods to the most affected community including 5 latrines especially constructed for disabled people.
To  strengthen the local markets-Based Programming (MBP) approach AADSOM will ensure that:
- The service providers should be selected locally if available.
- The contracted service providers should purchase the required material and equipment in the local market if available.
- The contracted service provider should hire skilled and skilled workers from the local people.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somalia&#x2019;s prolonged humanitarian crisis is characterized by ongoing conflicts, climate-related shocks, communicable disease outbreaks, and weak social protection mechanisms. Since the beginning of 2020, three additional shocks have contributed to a deterioration of humanitarian conditions: Extensive floods, Desert Locust infestations, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These compounding shocks have exacerbated humanitarian needs among a population already living under the strain of widespread poverty and decades of armed conflict and insecurity. Climate change continues to be a major contributing factor to displacement and food insecurity in Somalia.
Increasingly erratic weather patterns and climatic shocks have led to prolonged and severe drought conditions and floods, with devastating humanitarian consequences. Flooding displaced 919,000 people in 2020 and destroyed essential infrastructure, property, and 144,000 hectares of agricultural land. a serious lack of access to clean water and sanitation is heightening the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases exacerbating existing fragilities, especially where health services are too few and/or too distant. In this project, ARD is aimed to improve access to WASH services for Ceelberde IDPs, host communities with recognition of people of disabilities, and the most vulnerable population through the provision of safe water drinking with water vouchers for 60 days period,. Construction/rehabilitation of 22 flood-proof shallow wells with hand pumps, benefiting around 11,000 (2500 men, 5700 women, 1400 girls, and 1400 boys) crisis-affected IDPs and host communities will be under taken. ARD will also construct 50 flood-resistant latrines to benefit residents in the Ceelberde IDP sites which will also receive the clean water and hygiene promotions and hygiene kits. Approximately, 10% of the 50 latrines (corresponding to 5) will be preserved for people with disabilities living in the target locations. A total of 2500 (500 men, 1500 women, 250 girls, and 250 boys) people will benefit from access to the sanitation, 1000 Households will benefit from hygiene kit distribution and hygiene awareness, Chlorination of wells and WASH committees will be established in addition, carry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Ceelberde district,</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The World Health Organization (WHO) South Sudan Country program is proposing a project titled &#x201C;provision of Emergency Response Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Front-line Health Workers performing critical public health functions during the COVID-19 epidemic. 
The 6 months&#x2019; project will be implemented in the 10 states of South Sudan and will deliver Personal Protective equipment(PPEs) to an estimated 2,268 (794 Female and 1,474 Males) Fontline Health Workers. The project identifies Frontline Health Workers to include the following five categories of beneficiaries (Staff working in rapid response units, Triage, Health workers, Screeners and Laboratory workers supporting Covid-19 response at 1,315 health facilities, POCs ( Malakal ,WAU, Bentiu, Juba and Bor) and other emergency locations within the country. Provision of PPEs will ensure that Front line Health Workers performing critical public health functions such as contact tracing, sample collection, laboratory diagnosis, case management, reactive vaccination and mobile clinics in remote areas have appropriate industry certified Personal Protective Equipment&#x2019;s. 
WHO will contribute USD277,570.09 from its COVID-19 solidarity response fund set up primarily to mobilize funding towards implementation of the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response plan. One of the main objectives of the fund is &#x2018; buying and shipping essential supplies such as masks, gloves and protective wear for frontline workers&#x2019;. More information on the Fund can be obtained from www.COVID19ResponseFund.org</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Sudan is one of the most complex humanitarian operating environments. Humanitarian needs are dispersed across the country, often in areas very difficult to access due to geographical remoteness, lack of infrastructure, and insecurity. According to the last South Sudan Humanitarian Access Severity Overview released by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in November 2019, difficult physical environment, including poor road conditions, was the most prevalent access challenge reported by partners.

Since July 2020, humanitarian needs in the country have dramatically increased due to unprecedent rainfalls leading to floods along the White Nile. OCHA reports over 866,0000 individuals are affected with 389,000 individuals having been displaced by the floods (OCHA: South Sudan: Flooding Snapshot as of 21-Oct-2020). The floods hit a population experiencing years of conflict, make them more vulnerable famine and hunger as well as water borne disease outbreaks. Key immediate needs include food, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), shelter and non-food items (SNFI), and health and nutrition services. A time effective and sustained humanitarian response requires humanitarian operational bases from which the flood-affected populations can be reached.

In October 2020 OCHA cited conflict, access, COVID-19, funds and lack of facilities from which humanitarian organizations can operate as the major gaps and challenges to the flood response.  Lack of operational bases with safe and adequate office and accommodation spaces for humanitarian agencies&#x2019; staff is a serious impediment to the humanitarian response particularly in the proposed project locations.

An inter-agency assessment in September 2019, identified the need for expansion of static and temporary humanitarian hubs in order to reach hard-to-reach populations.  


The objective of this project is to enable a humanitarian response to the floods by establishing two humanitarian hubs in Jonglei State which has the highest number of flood-affected people in South Sudan.

IOM proposes to establish a humanitarian hub in Jiech (Ayod County) and a light base camp in Pibor (Pibor County), both in Jonglei. 

Each of the proposed humanitarian hubs will accommodate approximately 15 to 20 humanitarian staff. Humanitarian agencies working from these hubs will be enabled to reach approximately 57,529 individuals in Ayod County and 95,835 individuals in Pibor County with life-saving WASH, SNFI, and health and nutrition services (targeted figures based on IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix as of 02 November 2020).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Flood response through Shelter and NFIs  in Bor South, Pibor and Ayod areas of Jonglei State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This 6 months&#x2019; project will focus on &apos;&apos;Providing access to emergency shelter and lifesaving non-food items to the flood displaced people in Bor South, Pibor and Ayod Counties of Jonglei State from November 2020 to April 2020. The project will reach 61,000 persons affected by flooding (17,934 men, 18,666 women, 11,956 boys and 12,444 girls) with an estimated total of 2224 persons living with disabilities (4% of the total target).

The project team will distribute 10,166 shelter/NFI kits to the flood affected people. Each kit will include 2 plastic sheets, 2 mosquito nets and 2 rubber ropes at minimum. The distribution of shelter and NFIs will be based on vulnerability criteria, addressing the needs of large families, households with children under 5, pregnant or lactating woman (PLW), unaccompanied elderly (gt 60 years), people living with disability (PLWD), female headed households, child headed households, unaccompanied minors and the chronically ill.

NRC will work through the rapid response team/mobile teams (RRT) supported by NRC static team in Bor South to register and verify beneficiaries, distribution of Survival/shelter kits will be done. The kits shall be requested from core pipeline through the cluster recommendation.

In line with the allocation strategy, the project will ensure inclusiveness and participation ensuring equitable participation. In assessments, distribution committees will be encouraged and supported, while distribution activities will be scheduled to allow for women and girls involvement

The project will promote timely delivery of assistance through deployment of mobile teams in line with humanitarian response priorities for 2020 as outlined in the HRP as well as the flood response in South Sudan. NRC&#x2019;s mobile response teams will be ready for deployment within 8 days to conduct assessments/validation of beneficiaries and within 14 days for full-fledged delivery of NFIs supported by some staff from NRC static office in Bor South.

The project team will work in close coordination with S/NFI cluster, cluster focal points, and its activities will be informed by the gaps identified through the assessment missions carried out by NRC or other actors on the ground or joint assessments. NRC will also coordinate its operations with CIDO, HDC, CRS, PAH, IDEAS South Sudan, South Sudan Red Cross and Health Link among others that are already operational in some of the locations e.g. Bor South.

The specific needs of the persons displaced by floods have shortage of shelter and WASH supplies. Other actors like PAH are responding to the WASH needs and NRC will focus on distribution of  Shelter and NFI kits to meet the shelter needs of men, women, boys and girls. These beneficiaries will be selected  jointly with the community and will put into considerations the minimum standards of protection and shelter due diligence guidelines. 

The project team will ensure that women and girls are not exposed to risk of sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) at the distribution points and to have the distribution site within short walking distances from the beneficiaries&#x2019; homes/areas of displacement. In case drinking water is not available in nearby locations, water will be provided by NRC team at the distribution sites. Elderly, physically incapable, pregnant women and others who require special attention will be prioritized during distribution so that they are served early and comfortably. Feedback desk will be provided at each distribution site so that beneficiaries register their complaints with NRC on the entire project process and quality of the supplies/Kits. NRC will conduct post distribution Monitoring (PDM) in at least at 50% in locations of distribution.

The project will be implemented in line with the COVID-19 guidelines ensuring that the staff and beneficiaries ensure social distancing, using face masks and washing ha</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Effective provision of basic life-saving NFIs and Emergency Shelter materials to most vulnerable flood - affected population through In -kind modality to vulnerable communities in Juba (Mangalla) and Awerial counties, south Sudan.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under this project, Polish Humanitarian Action (PAH) will provide life-saving emergency shelter materials and life-sustaining non-food items to the most vulnerable populations, focusing on floods &#x2013;affected internally displaced persons, HC and returnees in Juba County, Central Equatoria state  and Awerial county of Lakes state and other priority locations in South Sudan, through mobile response modality lasting up to 6 months which will contribute to the reduction of protection risks and reduce exposure to diseases attributed with poor shelter conditions and lack of non-food items. The Project will support the existing coping mechanisms of the local community. Builds resilience towards other shocks, that have indirect effect (such as the worsening economic situation). Mobile modality will be supported with community awareness on Covid-19 to reduce health and protection risks to women and girls during distribution. Environmental awareness campaigns will also be done including HLP issues.
PAH will conduct in-depth need analysis, verification and distribution with the involvement of protection staff and the participation of the target populations through consultative community meetings, key informant interviews, focus group discussions with men, women, boys and girls, household level and individual interviews, and direct observations conducted by the assessment teams at household level to identify the needs of affected gender, age and diversity groups, the vulnerabilities of the targeted community and coping strategies employed by the affected population. The activities will be planned and implemented jointly with Nutrition, FSL,WASH, Health and S/NFI actors working in Juba and Awerial. PAH will target 42,500 beneficiaries (17,000 IDPs, 14,875 HC and 10,625 returnees 6,800 men,7,650 women, 13,600 boys, 14,450 girls) focusing on female headed households, unaccompanied elderly, people with no links to the community, separated children, women at risk (pregnant and lactating mothers), child-headed households, people living with disability and returnees whose properties were damaged and looted during the conflict.
PAH plans 5 interventions - 3 in Awerial and 2 in Juba. In case of needs reaised in other locations, after cluster recommendation and UN OCHA accept PAH is ready to intervene in other locations. In areas where PAH is dedicated to respond it is reported 87 000 people are affected by the floods (53 000 in Awerial and 34 000 in Juba).
PAH teams will comprise of experienced ES/NFI officers and protection personnel (50% women and 50% men). Two protection officers will participate in interventions with close coordination and collaboration with the Protection Cluster. The team will implement the interventions jointly with other partners&#x2019; particularly static partners, especially ES/NFI, WASH, FSL and Protection actors and in close coordination with the respective clusters (SFPs) and cluster coordinators will be involved in the planning, coordination and reporting of the interventions.</narrative>
